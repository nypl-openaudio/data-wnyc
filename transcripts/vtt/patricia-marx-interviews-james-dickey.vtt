00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm delighted to have as my guest today one of America's major poets Mr

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
James Baker. Mr Dickey has been published in almost every literary

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
periodical and is the author of four volumes of verse into the stone drowning

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
with others helmets and most

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
recently bucked dancers choice which won the National Book Award for Poetry.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Mr Dickey you've taught in your force in World War two and in Korea and

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
you worked for years in various advertising agencies.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
When did poetry become the major concern in your life.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I don't

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
know I don't even know that it is a major concern of my life

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
now but it began to. Take a dominant position on gas when I when

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I no more began to get fascinated with the sound

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.000
of my own

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
voice sort of sort of like.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Finding out that you have a certain natural aptitude for something not all that's natural it might be unnatural but.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
What really fascinated me was when I saw and this was one night I can remember I just

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
walking down the supermarket about groceries and the idea came to

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
me that I could put words in a certain order and they

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
would stay as I put them

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
down on paper and they would say what I told him to say that they're so

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
fascinated me I think I'll never get to the end of it for the rest of my

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
life. Does this happen before you before you actually did it or after you've been writing for

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.000
a

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
while after I'd been writing. All right no while but the fact that you have absolute domination

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
of all of the languages.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
If you if you just know what you want to make it do and if you can can make it do that

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and then it develops a fascination that nothing

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
else has I thought do you actually feel that much in control of the language

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
or sometimes the language dictate what it's going to say to

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
you. Hard to say about that I think sometimes one sometimes the

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
other but there is an absolute relation between the awfulness

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
poem you did say it you might have been building better than you know but

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
that something that you put down. You can remember the physical act of doing it

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and and the revisions and so on why you made the decision cut this out put

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
this in so on it is something that

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
you you will understand the fall against or borrow

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
the against time.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
How had you been reading long before you actually had something published or did to come about

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
quite close time.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Not for a long road. I was going to major in philosophy

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and I did major and philosophy and Vanderbilt and minored in astrophysics.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
An odd combination. Unlike most people who go to college.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I wanted I was twenty three when I started after the

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.000
war had been to college a little bit before but I didn't get any credit because I left for the semester.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And I went to Vanderbilt and I thought What the hell I got the G.I. bill and why don't I why don't I just

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
take things that interest me you know. I wrote wrote

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
some when I was an undergraduate and and the teachers that I

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
had Vanderbilt was very encouraging and they seem to like what I was doing a lot I myself didn't

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I was like it

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and and so around the time I

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
was saying you know I guess an aging senior of twenty

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
six when I was six there was

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
a poem to the Swan interview and John Palmer accepted it

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and and I thought well you know maybe if I can

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
do this I can go in and explore the medium a little more and

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and you know let's just see what happens. And so I'm just all built up from

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000
there when you said that you weren't sure that poetry is the major concern of your life.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
One of the other contenders is

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
teaching you know not teaching really and I like teaching. Very much but it doesn't absolve

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
me that much on I don't know I remember something in a Hemingway novel

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.000
while one of the characters says about life great abstraction.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Maybe if you learn how to live in it you learn what it's all about that's what that's what I'm trying to

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
do I just want

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
to learn how to live and live live my life the best way for

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
me to live it and poetry is. His part of it but so was his

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
offer a soul as

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
a way to lift and so is taking care of my family

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
so my personal relationships with people and

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
so a lot of other things I mean I would distrust anybody

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
who who gave him poetry so much primacy that nothing

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
else mattered but poetry that this would be wrong because poetry is and is and

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
ever on art that that comes out

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
of experiences is a kind of an interpretive

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
org And if you don't have those you don't have

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
any any any material to or to write about.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
I wonder you did most of your life in the south you were born in Atlanta Georgia.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Do you feel in any way that you are a regional poet or that your roots are in

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
South my roots and definitely in but I'm not like I'm original put

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
it all on I don't know the South and saw the history of the

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and not so much a proponent of the Southern

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
mystique isn't my very great teacher Donna Davidson was

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
invented Vanderbilt My remember just as and

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
few conversational passes said Mo to me about poetry than almost anybody else has ever

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
done and I'm not

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
I'm I've lived away from it too many to him too much and lived in other places.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
I love the world we're in March so the South is my place the southern United States because of

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
the because I was. Accidentally

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
bond but the great the great thing about existence seems to me than

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
almost the computer. And supermarket

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
assed aspect of things is saddening to may not love to be in Europe where

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
you can go across the street and everything changes the cuisine

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
the wine the local causes everything changes and different is different. That's something

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000
that wouldn't have been there if these people hadn't developed in this particular locality.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
That's what that's what makes it go

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
from Les. When you say that poetry is part of your life and

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
certainly not the major part. Can you describe it all the experiences in

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
your life that that form the basis that had the greatest impact

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
on poetry.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
I don't know I have I have this one idea though that seems to me to be true surely in

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
my case I don't know if it is to other people but I suspect that it is that there are that there

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
are all kinds of different people different kinds of characters

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
in in any one person he

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
has orders and every man is both an angel and

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
a beast that that's true and there there.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
There is a.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
There is a side of me in that that has nothing to do with poetry at

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000
all it's an it's and simply

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
an aging ex athlete who reads the papers to

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
sound Georgiades are loaded against Dick tiger with the most interest in the

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
world of what time Michael are there in the four hundred metres and last

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
week you know that that's one side and I would that side would

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
be contained I would write never to read or write or read a word

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
of poetry as another sounded likes to hearten I'd like to consort

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
with with archers and. And is

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
a member of the California vomit

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000
color's

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Association and there's another sounded like folk musicians and like the phone.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Tradition especially the guitar on a banjo bluegrass amusing and would also

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.000
be contented to write any poetry but just sit around and talk to musicians and listen to.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
And play and hopefully play with them.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
And listen to records while the really great ones play like Doc Watson for

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
example. And then there's a side that likes Scala things

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
and likes to live at least in rhetoric and

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
the great ecclesiastic writers like Lang Jeremy

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Taylor and there's a side that likes to read novels over a relatively

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
relatively obscure side and not and with not a great deal of authority that likes to

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
read novels and then there's another woman likes to write poetry

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
and a good deal of it because a lot

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
he's he's fascinated by what possibilty might occur the next time a

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:54.000
system to

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
try I wonder if you could describe how a poem comes into

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
being you can tell us all different from so the different ones but I'll tell you

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
for me now them and created create I used to just sometimes I just start out with a war that same

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
code with a quark context. You know but this is not really

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000
of our profitable way from a what now. What I now get is a.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Is a kind of a of a communication from the beyond hope so it seems

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000
that this that of the

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
other thing that I remember that I've read about or that I've encountered someone somewhere

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000
or another or some way or

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000
another another would is a potential for the kind of poetry that I write.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Sometimes these days these things will lie buried in what the guys William

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
James call the deep well of unconscious cerebration for a long time.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
The only rule of thumb I have is that when

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
something. Some image or some van or something comes back to

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
me enough then I know that eventually I'll have to deal with

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
it and I try to deal with but it.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
There they are they're just the sort of irrational associations that keep flowing to the surface is if you keep

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
thinking to yourself Well you remember when I did that all you men when I saw

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
that NACA take that and

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
maybe we could use that as a sort of a

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
dramatic framework to say on this that or the other thing. Or as

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
a situation itself it's just so interesting to write about it so

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
unusual that maybe we can maybe we can maybe we're going to sort of

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
start playing around with and see what happens next this is the last of the Web

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Start where it ends at

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
some this thinking when you say something haunts you enough that you know you've got

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
to deal with it the pony what you mean by Deal with it do you understand it better when you've

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
written about you know what that's that's right. Like I like to think so

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
but sometimes it turns in to suffer some kind of sea change undergoes a sea change where

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
it's different where you don't understand the thing itself as it

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
occurred but a but another thing

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
happened which is better than the original and.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
And understand that isn't a higher act of understanding

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
than understanding the actual circumstance in which the point came

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
and that's that's as close as I can come to the phone and what happened to what I what I think rather happens

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
if you do you become more aware of what you've experienced

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
you can sharpen your own

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
awareness and Yes yes but there still is still stand somewhat apart from what you

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
said about it.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
You know you know how what

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
you've based the poem on. But you also remember

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
how it was you know you see what you've made of it

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
and what you always hope and follow is a truth that you've invented is a

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
better truth than the actual truth. You know the most

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
dramatic interesting more profound truth a more

00:11:59.000 --> 00:11:59.000
poetic truth.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Then what's your age and I began what is there a distinction

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
between you was a private individual and you as a poet. I mean. Yeah Felix

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Yes I definitely you know how in what way.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Well I dislike people my list again on this

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
and I dislike people who insist on living like poets because I really

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
don't know what poets live like my idealism is of

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
somebody like Bach who was and who was an ordinary man who just sat

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
down and wrote Remora

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
music and not and not somebody who'd who lives the poem

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000
the what is sort of come to be the lowlife tradition of power of the poet like Baudelaire.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Are like Dylan Thomas like Theodore at because some of the time.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
There is a kind of a feeling among ports that I sort of oh it to themselves to be awful.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
You know and that people will endure them to people more than anything they can

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
do. I've had my awful times but it's

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
not something that that that ought to be normative that it ought to be a lot

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
of that ought to just.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
In your poems. Dickie you often express a kind of pantheism and

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
a desire to lose yourself in nature. I wonder if you could

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
describe it or your attitude towards nature.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
I don't really know what my attitude toward it is except that it. Except

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
that when you really stop to look at it now or look at

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
anything from a glass grass blade to the bark on a

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000
pantry to the way the sun hits the lake. Now the way I'm out in the shade of

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000
a

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
mountain.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
It's unbelievably

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
miraculous you feel if you really love deeply enough the

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
main feeling that you have all that I have is that what it is is that that that.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Of our privilege being to be here to be doing

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
this

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
privileged someone that can't so many millions have been have

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
done but the but the intensity of you know the

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
single moment of some small

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
small thing that you notice that nobody else and this is

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
probably if you have a if you need a definition as probably the poetic moment.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Most of your poems out of your own prison experience.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Well there but you'd have to guess I guessed if I want my personal experiences a lot of

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
them are things which are a long road of literally every word of that is

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
true every word is one of the few that is and but there

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
are other things that

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
I may have read about in a newspaper or

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
an account and some kind of women when you encounter things I mean a lot of different ways you can encounter

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000
him you can encounter

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
him. They can and they can be real people in real situations and things that you've done and people that

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
you've known they can be things that you would like to have done and people you would like to have

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
known they can be things that like in the heaven of animals which is I

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
guess become a while a circular thought

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
to pieces came from watching the Walt Disney films the African

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
lion and another long thing a man and I'm doing

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
for the last world for rain came from another Disney film

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
wide wilderness. So you take it where you can get it. Anything that impresses you as

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
an idea or as an image and there's nothing that says there's no law that says you can't try to do

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000
something with

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
the thing that puzzles me is is your poetry used

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
to express such a reverence for nature for life for

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
living beings human and animal. How can you when you love animals so

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
much also hunt. Well contradiction.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
No there and there really isn't a contradiction hard some.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Much different and I'm not good I'm not a I'm not a really first

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
rate option or good or really first rate stalker the thing that

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000
I like

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
the most is that it gets me into the relation with

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
them and then. But I can vent some animals live

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000
live their lives and and the most precarious possible circumstances.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
And there is that intensification that if you are saying and do come

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
down to drink in a creek and the first dawn

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
light you understand you

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
understand the intense nervous awareness that

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000
they always live in the never free of it at that kind of intensity

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
could be got into poetry it would be remarkable and it

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
would the animal awareness in this that they

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
live their lives or any animal lives with it has

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
any possibility of being hunted either by men or other animals'

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
lives in a situation in

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.000
which in which every possibility has to be instinctively considered.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
They won't put a foot down if they're going to make a noise. They have

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
to come they drink like see this.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Doesn't offend you as a sensitive human being to kill the

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
very thing not at all not at all not at all odd love love love the

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
and. How can

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000
it because that's that's the sign that they

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
understand that you can do is to try to kill them.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000
I mean if I sentimentalise and took pictures of them and that sort of thing that

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000
that wouldn't I wouldn't be in as deep a relationship of the day as I would if

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
I was trying to go that's something they understand that's the environment that they live

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
in that's what they they will develop in order to

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
evade and in trying and trying to in trying

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
to kill. I'm with that very close range with an arrow. That means that I've got to enter

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000
into their environment I've got to try to second guess them and I was in a sense I've got to become

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
an animal with them and this is something that I'm convinced they

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
appreciate had very indifferent

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
success but it's only in that relation that the that

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
the full connection between me and them can exist

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000
if I saw him and I gave my love a honey you know I should go something like that

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
that's that's condescending. That's me

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
being a human

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
and patronize ing them as a Swede

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000
the Latin

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000
model but to go out into the into their country with them match wits

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000
with them play the great the great game with them and it seems to me that

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:51.000
that's

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000
honoring him in a way this sticky Joan hole we lock wrote about your first

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
volume of poetry into the

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
stone and I couldn't hear if one must find fault. One must

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
find fault. It would be with an occasional unintentional obscurity that

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Morrison poems and I wonder if you would Mr security whether

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
you well know I would try to do admit to it I guess I don't know what other

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000
people I know perfectly well what I mean a heart attack but other people would be able

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
to get it out but that there are problems

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
and. What I want to do really was to find a way

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
of being simple without going fan and it's I guess in a

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000
way kind of paradoxical

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
that the way that I chose to try to achieve that was

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
to write this kind of very

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000
clotted

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
difficult poem poetry in the beginning and then try to crowd

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000
or to keep the intricacy and get a much more simple diction

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:54.000
to express

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
it in your most recent dances choice you make.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Frequent use of the broken line and I wonder what the function of that

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000
is well on the broken one of the split in

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
the car some reviewer calls it and is.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
I guess just a kind of a device to try

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
to what I originally conceived of it as as a device

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000
to try to reproduce. What seems to happen in the mind when I want to

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000
so Shiites and when one and an addition this kind of

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000
splitting off of words by four or five

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.000
typewriter spaces which is the way I presented the poem so the editors which publish them.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Results in a kind of an awed breathless on

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
rushing quality that I like very much. I guess enough and I way it's what the

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
Tech freshman English textbooks called

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
impressionistic I don't have any quarrel like that only you know I'll quote I don't have

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
any quarrel with that it's only a question of whether it works in a particular context

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000
and what you feel you can do with it that you couldn't

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
do in the past

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:14.000
by your sound is different the sound is different the flow is interrupted the.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
There is a kind of and what I what I what I really wanted to have

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000
a prime sound like is

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:26.000
the is the inspired stammering is of a village idiot.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:35.000
But they have to be inspired stammering not just an establishing.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
Do you feel that in your most recent poetry. You're trying new things

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
or is this just your organic development do you feel you're grappling with

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000
new problems or new new techniques

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000
are always always I've got. I've got another book coming out

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
called Falling which

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:59.000
is different from any of the others different from from the.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Relatively predictable experimentation of into

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
the Stones or the

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
plastic stuff that I did most mostly in drowning with others

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
and the

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
experimental sort of song

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
of what you would say. Of helmets except that it was a sort of an

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000
extension of drowning with others balked at the choices different from either one of those reads

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000
very differently to May and following is different from ADD So this is a great lesson of the car so

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
I NEVER a lot of sense a bit trapped in a style.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000
I remember reading somewhere Cocteau on Cocteau's advice to

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000
poets was find out what you can do best and then don't do

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000
it do you think in stylistic Tunes or do you

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000
really think about what is you want to say in the best form comes from the

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
context but I know what I'm going to work in for working toward more and more as.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000
The possibility of making statements that

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000
people will believe which will not be able or statements like go down to the most of

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000
them are going to get me a six pack of Budweiser. That's a statement. But there's also

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
a statement you can make in Carteret which is

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000
amazing I want to try to be able to make amazing statement.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
Let's take you I wonder if you would tell us what

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000
other poets writing today in American you most admired.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Well I think Theodoret is the greatest poet We have had in this country. I don't think there's any any

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:40.000
any possible competition to him not even Whitman who I guess will be the next best.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
He had the essential thing

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000
which is the ability to make his time sound

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
like the Earth itself or speaking to you

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000
and the rest of the people compared to him seemed.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Hopefully artificial. And got up done on

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000
purpose. You know but he didn't have that he had that natural it's like somebody has a

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
beautiful stride or signed a pitcher like Sandy cofactor who has

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000
a great on you just had that natural saying everybody else seems unnatural

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000
compared to him and that's an important thing to me.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000
William Stafford has some of that I thank you is a very good thought all of

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000
our wasteful writes too much but what the best of his sons

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000
are just wonderful to Jane's right is good he's got a lot of

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
the same kind of natural gas that right

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
hand and then Louis Simpson is guilty as a fine and

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
biting incisive uncompromising

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
nervous

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000
Merican quality which I think is awful and those about the best ones

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000
of my

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000
might do no women thought

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000
that I would still be able to write a letter saying that

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000
I stress and I go. Somebody like Sylvia

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
Plath is a mildly interesting rather kind of

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
a kind of a gab a mystification what it is and it

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
has no real sustaining power. It doesn't really hit you it hits you as

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000
an X.. Display or an excellent display of

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000
literary virtues and that's it the key of A final question what

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000
is your feeling about the state of poetry today and do you feel that there's so much

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000
talk that is dying the way theater is dying. Do you feel it is in a

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
vital phase or and its future is bright.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
You go or you go around to schools and read and you see how bright it really

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000
is there is a sort of shamefaced NESA bound to some kids who come to

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000
poetry readings

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000
and they their mothers want to move go on and be good C.P.A.'s and everything and here they

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000
have this. Sneaking and kind of. It's criminal interest in

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000
poetry

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
but if you go and talk to you give them some kind of hard

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.000
to give them some kind of hope about one and you say yes and use Reggie write those poems

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000
and and if you want to spend your life as a poet spend it you've only got one if you want it that

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000
much to do it.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000
That kind of an example. Well that's been afforded by wrecked by

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Louis Simpson or anybody else who gives a lot of readings is I think probably going

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000
to

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000
Marge maybe through various circumlocutions themselves or any in

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000
ways as a very real fact of the American consciousness one of

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.000
these days. Thank you Mr Dickey You've been listening to the American

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000
poet James Dickey whose recent volume of various Bach dances choice

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000
won the National Book Award for Poetry. Thank you and goodbye for now.
