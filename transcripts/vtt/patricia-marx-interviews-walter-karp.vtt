00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
There's been a great deal of talk about the need for a new politics. I'm delighted to have is

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
my guest today because founder and editor of The New Journal of new politics

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
called the Public Life. He is Mr Walter Karp who's a

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
writer biographer and also a contributing editor to horizon magazine.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Mr Carr There are literally hundreds of small magazines and journals. What did you find

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
it important to start a new one.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Because I think we have something to say and. We have a principle to stand for

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
which I'm afraid isn't buried under a great deal of

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
abuse and

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
content and that doesn't the press was not offended anyway. You know on the left

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
or the right on the liberal slant or would you define your

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
principles or simply were radical Democrats. We believe

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
in the Republic which is that which is the body politic

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
of self-governing citizens which is in fact what the Republicans meant to

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
the principle of those owners of the great simply that and then are

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
political beings and that if they are ruled by have no

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Sharon rule they are barbarians or yahoos

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
like actually

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
say well you know this sounds almost like a political given I mean

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I can't imagine that it isn't if you ask Humphrey your mixes

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
with both running for president both would agree with you know how do you differ

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
from the mainstream of the Democratic or Republican Party.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Well there's not a name there in the mainstream of the Republican Party or the Democratic Party or I might add on the left is a

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
belief that the self-governing citizen is the highest good. I mean where for example the Democratic

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Party

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
had stated I want to highest purposes of the country is to increase the economic

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
growth rate and to solve problems of special interest groups. Namely part of

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
the poverty.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Education for the people various

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
people but this is not just state that the citizen is the highest

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
good himself but the act of citizen governing himself. Now the Democrats and

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
as a matter of fact would like to keep as many functions as possible at the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
federal level on a narrow supposition is that.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The local groups are reactionary.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
But isn't there a great deal of historical present present in

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
the local control means reactionary control particularly

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
could take examples in the south.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I guess I'm glad you mention the South because whenever we say Jeffersonian isn't a

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
local democracy somebody turns around and says to us that that sounds like George Wallace and states' rights.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Well the fact is and it's a fact you can find any government textbook.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Is that the South has gone further than the strong local democracy of any state in the country they

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
have no township government there are no district schools. Everything is done at the county level which

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
is manipulated by the State House and the state house is a one party

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
oligarchies in fact a real description of a southern state is a banana republic.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Now when you set the state's rights means they don't want to federal government interfering with their happy

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
little oligarchies Yeah we had an interesting fact in the recent issue of

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
the public life.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Namely that Minnesota there are nine thousand local governing bodies government governmental bodies

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
of some kind in Virginia there are only four

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
hundred you know that's a startling difference. Another reason for that difference is

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
not economic and it's not social and it's not due to his forces of history. It's not due to any number

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
of things that a good many sophisticated

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
people think controls what happens in this world was due simply to a one

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
party oligarchies run by Harry Byrd very efficiently to undercut

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
local democracy. What he did was something usurp local local powers for the same reason everyone or

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
every usurping does to increase his own.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Well how would. I knew but also

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
very good going back to this sounding princes of the country but how would this

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
change the existing structure what kind of new bodies would you see would you

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
want to have come into power.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
You know Jefferson used to say that he wanted to end every speech he ever made by

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
saying divide the counties in towards what he meant as you want

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
to multiply the number of small units of government local councils

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
local representative bodies.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Presently the present system we have is one in which the federal government and the one party

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
state houses rule below the state level there's an

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
increasing just really dismantling of democracy over another one hundred

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
hundred years or more.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
It's never ever never I mean then for every number of kinds of Rufus I give you one example the

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
last governor's withering away of the country township government is whether it way. Why does it wither away

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
like it turns out the only reason is not that the word modern world has gotten too complex for

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
a village. It's simply that it's very

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
expensive for a village to carry out certain functions. They don't make they own

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
the only kind of revenues there are a lot of raise our incomes real

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000
estate tax

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
estimates now the decision by the state house to start to take away a village political function and

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
put it at the county level or to put it into a state of

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
ministration is a political decision they could easily have given the village

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
money simply so you ask what kind of structural change would be involved what we

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
call it just the extension of the federal principle in the federal government. You

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
know constituted federal government of state house the states for below

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
that and the village level the district level and within

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
the city cities which are themselves an out of home rule by the way. Within the cities there

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
are neighborhoods wards precincts none of which have any representative bodies. So you see

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
below the State House level is a vacuum.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
How are you going to. Fill this vacuum. I mean doesn't this have to come as a spontaneous desire on the

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
part of the people who are going to be doing the governing themselves and if they've been

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
living their way isn't this an indication that this is not what people want or

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
are willing to spend time doing.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Well as an awful lot of cancer and an awful lot of cover stories which

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
have hidden the fact of the usurpation of local

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
rights most important of wine which I mentioned several times already is simply

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
the notion that the modern world is very complicated and that therefore local the local local

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
concerned are incapable of governing when you look and this cover where local governments have

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
been had their political powers removed you'll find that it was a decision a

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
political decision quite freely

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
made no pressure upon it by people

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
who at a higher level of government to do what people to higher levels of government of done since the time they

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
were government simply take as much power as they can.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
So you have to at least as a start in the public life you try to do

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
this it's on the strip for a certain amount of cover stories for example people will tell

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
you that in Nassau County in New York.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
The local groups are so reactionary that they don't want any public housing built in

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Nassau and whether it's true or not there are not very much public housing you know out of the poor housing for

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:19.000
young

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
people and the other the other week in The New York Times. There was an article saying that

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
housing was a proposal had been made to put housing on the county

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
level but. There's a liberal solution you take things away from

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
reactionary local groups and you put it at a county level or this or at the state level or at the

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
federal level where good natured benign federal officials will do the

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Liberal good thing. Now the real fact about Nassau

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
County and this I got from Eugene like a certain self who is

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
the county executive is that this political structure in Nassau County is

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
rigged in favor of the Republicans. There are three large townships one.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Hands that one of those debates you want to

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Freeport they are all Republican townships and they control a large number of

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
both

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000
unincorporated villages. None of which have any political power.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
He's not interested in pushing up local powers to the county level.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
He's interested in recreating real two party fights in

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Nassau he wants incorporated or unincorporated villages. He wants

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
to break the up because the township holding companies which are a

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Republican and so that whatever liberality of spirit there isn't

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Nassau have a chance to come out. Now that's all we ask but we are I would like to see

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
people say that at least the first principle of democratic polity is a two party system.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
And that does not exist in very many places.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
What success is because in having

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000
now only cousin said it all and his proposal is a pious hope. Quite frankly.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
And the reason it's a pious hope is not because the Republicans won't give an inch of course they won't give an age the reason is

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
that the Democrats do not contest outside New York

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000
City and they want to go into that story it's a very interesting story in a very long story.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
It's the story of the division of the state of New York. Into two small

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000
one party. Satrapi

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
as you know the woods is a two party system but in each each area one party is working

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000
on challenge.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
That's right. That's exactly the case and this happened one hundred years ago and happen not

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
only often happen in Massachusetts. I mean it's going to put Kate in

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Illinois somewhat later on but it was a kitten situation simply because the Republicans who run the

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
State House in those days.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Gave the Democratic political machines a franchise to run the

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
city pocket the urban vote. You know or as Alan Evans said manage the

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:53.000
urban

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000
vote. And keep everything keep the urban mobs down

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000
simply down and in turn. That beautiful franchise because let's face it what does a politician

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
want life more than to have no other than to have a second party

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:13.000
disappear in return for that franchise they do not contest the Republicans outside.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
New York State is marvelous because there's really no reason for fin York to be a

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Republican you know in terms of the usual socio economic factors.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
I thought would be more rural that it would

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
be if it isn't very rural the total rural

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
vote in a gubernatorial election upstate is twelve percent.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Now there are seventy percent of the upstate voters

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
urbanized a New York city dweller when he thinks about upstate it all

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
closes eyes and imagines a hayseed but in fact there's very few of them.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Mr Kopp when you speak of a more citizen participation and of citizens being so this

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
is primarily are you talking in terms of a new party. Or are you talking tunes

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000
of working within the the existing party structure how you are going to

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000
see this take

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
shape in the first place let me make clear I don't mean just participation in

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
participation it should exist as a right.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
It's not as a free will act like like wrapping Red

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Cross bandages it's not giving a damn about the urban coalitions of it's the right of a

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
community to to govern

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
itself at least to be given as many public functions as it can reasonably

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
handle without stepping on some other part of other local group.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
So I don't suddenly say participation we don't mean just getting involved. That's a kind of

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
vague phrase which people always use against

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
you and you have to be very clear and keep your principles political and strictly

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
political the citizen the community election. Representative

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
bodies and right to run things. Now I'm not interested of Iraq with the

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
giving as a favor to a local group the right to elect a couple of people to take

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
positions in the bureaucracy because that's us. That's their liking people for salaried jobs.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:00.000
I was going to taken

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
away. What they given him such a case is a privilege and we talk about

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
rights within you really not talking about parties at all you're talking about restructuring of the whole the

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
whole system the fabric of government

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
governance.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
But I hope not I hope that's not the case entirely the Republicans

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
I if you look at some of their statements

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
with what appeared of the more promising of the two parties.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
They do speak a local and local government and they do complain about federal

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
usurpations local rights but the fact is when you come down to it their definition of

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
the republic is capitalist country. In other

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
words that we inherited a political

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
order free political order based on the self-governing citizen and they tell you that it's a

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000
it's really an economic system. No more no less an economic system with

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
certain political institutions which help free the economy now though in truth

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
I confess the Democrats think the same thing only they think the capitalism has to be

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
somewhat alleviated or merely rated by certain federal

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
government functions. You know take care of welfare people or social security cases a lot of

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
health care or holes in the private enterprise system.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
So that strictly speaking neither party would be suitable

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
However

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
I hope that all of the Democrats. Françoise hard to say why. We

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
had written a book in the public life that since the Democratic Party's coalition

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
really depends on blacks and lower class whites

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
working like working people.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
The other party most to suffer from a real sharp break between the

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
races and since I

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
think that the only solution to the racial question is indeed local

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
democracy leave a proper

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
democratic party up you know it's in. Move it in some direction I mean it right now it's it is know

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
is deep in its bones the Paladino but. The old bread and butter issues are

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000
dead but they are looking for something the Republicans are not looking for anything at the moment so I say.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Perhaps foolishly that the Democratic Party is a better hope for returning to what in fact are its own.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Jeffersonian

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
roots salute when you see the bread and butter issues are dead. What is your

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
attitude towards them. There is a great lack of adequate

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
housing schools are inadequate. There are not enough

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
jobs for blacks particularly but

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000
unemployment is still high and in any event id's problems that you

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
feel are irrelevant already solved or would they be solved differently if there was

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
no local control.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Well I think if you felt very differently if if the powers that the

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Democratic Party

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
as a potent faction recognize the

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Republic and created recreating the Republic as its primary goal to take for example

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000
poverty it's not a simple case of want of

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
money and side effects not a complicated one definition of poverty is

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
entirely relative everyone understands that

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
it's in the lowest one third or one quarter of the

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
consumption scale those in other words if the middle class and

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Hollywood movies sort of lays down what the visitor Autumn of the good life

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
is that year in consumer goods and those below it up poor and I think

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000
the point every many

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
times sure but I mean still there though want better housing in the matter. You can

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
say participate but the fact is that there's not adequate housing for that person who

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000
is in the lower third of the

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
economy and you're saying that people want that housing more than they want their

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:48.000
political

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
rights no what I'm really asking is do you see these as a conflict or parallel or

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
no I don't think. For the phrase housing or the phrase

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
poverty the media. Cation a vast

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
federal funds and the federal government action. I'm not so

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
sure about that I was mentioning about

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
poverty. The relativity of poverty is not a small point it's a very important point

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
because if poverty means the lowest third of the consumption scale

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
and they will be never a cure for part of it. Yes I mean understand that I

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000
mean that there is this is not to belittle absolute poverty or the degradation of

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:27.000
the

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
poor but you are a society in which has no avenues

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
of achievement except consumption and indeed if you are the lowest third in the consumer scale

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
you are degraded and dispossessed and feel

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
it now as far as absolute poverty is

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
concerned the cure for absolute poverty is a guaranteed annual wage. There's no question

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
about that but the resistance to it come from it comes precisely from

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
a society of people who have no rights who don't govern

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
themselves who are the subjects of government only the subjects of government who are

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
told every day that their dignity and their respect and their self-respect comes from nothing

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
else than holding down a job that those people do not want to see anybody anything for nothing.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
They want to want to get anything something for nothing

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
themselves. So you see the way out of this is to give everyone

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000
a say in their in their own political future

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
and then the whole idea I mean they would have begin the. Not to a job through some

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000
kind of power as this is this

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
is right I mean for example there is we get richer and richer and richer

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
and yet we're told that we have no time for as well no time for

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
self-government and the something must be wrong with that formula. What are we getting richer

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000
for me through the history of the world with wealth meant

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
only one thing and meant time to be the

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
citizen in the ancient world very small percentage of people have the time for it

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
now we have time for it and we are told that the most important thing on earth is

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000
the employer's employment. Now tells us that the Democratic Party in fact told us that.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Now why I mean I mean every king would like to have all the citizens busy little

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:16.000
hardworking subjects' who never pick their nose up from the grindstone have to speak in the general terms about the case.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:16.000
So

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
I look I'd say I'm very skeptical about some aspect of the notion that full employment is the

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
most serious goal in this country. I wonder if we should have less employment and the fear

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
that people have about unemployment is really the fear

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.000
that. Idle hands do the devils work.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
But given a structure of political democracy. Given

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
the opportunity to be citizens I mean literally to work as a citizen.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
And they will have something else to do.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Now then you look at it then you look at the full employment from the point of view from the front of

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
the possibility that our wealth gives us gives us to allow men to participate in

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
local representative bodies and then you look rather suspiciously. On the insistence

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
that men want nothing except jobs.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
This sounds

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
like a lovely theory do you have knowledge.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Evidence that people really do want to participate and you're saying

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000
they do is there indication that people really want to take the time really care of the very

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
people you're talking about those that are owned. Well for those that

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:28.000
are unemployed underemployed in the poverty section of the economy.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Well I think the power of the big think they will know that well that's my most direct proof because as

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
soon as black men ask for local

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:43.000
self-government incomes. On Russia promises to give them jobs.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000
I mean is this the perfect response. Somebody wants a man wants to be a

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000
citizen and suddenly the Republican Party in the hands of Richard Nixon says Ah what everybody

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000
wants to be a capitalist every black man should be given the opportunity to run his own grocery

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
store and you say no we want to run our own. Institutions run

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
a grocery store you know if a grocery man you know you know can you have no connection with a community you're just doing the

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000
same act function in the community as a white man and I community did.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
The Democrat respond I'm a classic response as well as well as hardcore unemployment all these black people are honorable

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
men what they need is jobs and better jobs and that's in the

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
is the strongest indication

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
that when black people say they want to govern themselves

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000
they frighten the powers that be so I say the policy the is the politics

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000
and here's a point we consciously make our public life. Politics has motives of its own and then

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
our economic motives their political motives and they're a man and

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000
men in power

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
will give you all the money you want if you make sufficient trouble but he will

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.000
not give you and I were a power without him and I should make a lot of trouble.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
Mr Carter you've been talking about the need for citizens to

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000
govern themselves. You know what about the mechanics. I do have to set up a whole

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
new mechanism for this process to take place.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
Well eventually you would but I called to hire professor the government to help you do that figure out the

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:12.000
number

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000
of the number of times the election should be held in a given

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000
two year period of once or twice the size of districts for

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
whatever function political function is you return to local

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
citizens but that's really not the first and important point to the first point is simply

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
to convince people that a republic of self-governing citizens is not simply

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
a nice thing to have like. Clean

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000
air and better highways. But that is the

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000
highest good and that the dignity of man and and the role of a citizen

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000
are intimately connected. When you say a man is a free man you don't mean that people are

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000
not knocking him on the head and locking into jail arbitrarily there's a civil rights.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:02.000
You mean that he has that he is neither a rule or no rule. He's both.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
And that his dignity and his freedom consists in being able should he

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
wish to join with us fellows to initiate something

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
new for him to be free is to be politically for it and be politically free is to

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000
be a citizen.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Physically deal talk recently about the new politics about new coalition.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Do you see hope in these movements in terms of

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000
what you would like to see take

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000
place but I see hope in the

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
fairly frantic wish to find something new for the

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000
Democratic Party which is what some of the new politics is about. I don't so far

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
nothing in the standard new politics. The

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000
McCarthy

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000
supporters. As I think got down to the root of the issue. Now

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.000
the radical issue of the Republican self which is which isn't buried under much too much content for

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
people to usually.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000
In mass numbers restore right

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000
now the new left and the real New Left S.T.'s and so forth I mean they're

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000
the enemies of local democracy quite frankly. Yes yes started six years ago. One good

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000
idea namely local democracy and a large mass of Marxist cliches and six years

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
they forgot that one good idea only a left with Marxist cliches.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000
And there is a thing about it all this is the Marxists. Now understand that

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000
they cannot talk in materialistic language so well another too many people who

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000
are prosperous and too many of the poor a poor only in relation to mere

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000
prosperity. To really speak about the paradox of poverty in this the plant

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000
that they

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
don't they're looking for and they're looking for a spiritual.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
Sort of food our

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000
economic goal for the young people to seek namely love

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000
the concept of alienation somehow in the post revolution well minimal I.P.L. you

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.000
need it from their liberal elevation as one of the owners were like love on guard. Has a knife or

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000
about it.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000
The reason they're in this impasse is that they have contempt for political democracy and so they

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000
are stuck now trying to conceive of something attractive for the modern

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
age something which seem to be more spiritual is more rooted in the people except

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000
the dignity of man. So they throw out alienation and pray that no one will notice what

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000
it

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000
means it's really amazing a principle that seems almost

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000
a refuge but when you say it is a citizen's right to govern

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000
themselves is really one of the most radical statements

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000
and supported

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
statements going

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000
well and then died for a public that's forgotten. I mean women went to

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000
the scaffold for breeding the world system at one time.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Now you re professor of American fans of history will tell you that all about the economic.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000
Forces that determine the Constitution. You know I mean really. Denigrating their

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000
own foundation because you could not walk out in the street then the shores

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000
are not going to be

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
killed literally killed. Not that we were founded as a

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000
republic the strength of the man for a restored public life professionally in

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000
the fact that it exists and so when you stand for local democracy.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
You're standing for some that cannot be easily side stepped the question is to

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:31.000
convince them of goodwill. Well I think I've been dupes for a very very long time.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
Of the importance of making That's

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000
stand in for the wiping out of the mine air pollution and highways. You know

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
as primary goals and say once more that a Republican self-governing citizens

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000
is the highest good. I will fight for that

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000
first and when they do there is no one no one who can gainsay you because

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000
the man the political leader gets up and says we are not for local democracy has the find himself I need

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000
to find myself as a usurper and attack.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000
But this is really the role of your journal the public life.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000
And yes we simply our policy is very simple whatever enfranchise of

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
the citizen with for what this enfranchise of them are against but whenever

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000
some. Formula set up which seems to help people but

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
while disenfranchising them. We try to expose that first expose of the

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:29.000
different franchise one element and then quite frankly. You will discover that the help isn't a hell of a lot of help either.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000
I mean the history of Europe your chronic failure is enormous in this country you know.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000
And there's more to it than that I mean there are people who. If who will state the principle of the Republic in

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000
a kind of soft headed mealy mouth way they'll say we want

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:51.000
more participation. We want people to give a damn we want more involvement. We don't talk that way.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
We say political rights.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000
And then our citizens. When are you called as citizens and what that share of citizens is

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000
equality or political rights we don't talk about being helping out the black

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000
oppressed the black are oppressed because they're not citizens and the only way to help

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:14.000
a Black says blacks is to is to restore the power of the Philippines to ship to everybody.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:15.000
How

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000
does a citizen. How do citizens this new this program get a right to get a copy of the public

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:25.000
life after twenty I haven't you.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
