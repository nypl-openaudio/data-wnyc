00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
John Keats lived to be only twenty six years old yet he is one of our greatest

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
English

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
poets. My guest today is Miss Eileen Ward who has written a fascinating

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
study of this brief and passionate life in title. John

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Keats the making of a poet her work recently received the National Book Award

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
for Arts and Letters. This war there's been many studies of Keeton as poetry.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Why another book on Keats.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
That's a question that I asked myself a number of times in the course of writing this

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
book I could answer it very simply by saying

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
that year by year scholars turn up interesting new facts

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
about teats critics come out with new critical assessments

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
of him but none of these add up

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
to a new full length portrait of Keats and this was what

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I wanted to try. We haven't had full length biography of Keats

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
for some twenty five years now it seems already

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
to represent a rather old fashioned point of view.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
What exactly did you mean when you wrote that Keith's life shows a

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
significant completion the achievement of identity the self making art.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.000
This is

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
the this is the rule of focus of

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
my reinterpretation of Keats so far as I tried to give a

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
new portrait. I was first

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
struck when I was reading the

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
letters carefully by the word that he uses over and over again identity is

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
something that first of all he has a sense of not having He wrote several

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
rather extraordinary letters to the effect that the poet has no identity.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
He's the most an poetical of all characters in existence.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And then later in his career he speaks of this sense of identity as

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
something that is very. For him to achieve.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
About this time I read. Erick Erickson's.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Central book childhood in society in which he works out a very interesting theory

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
of identity as something that the young person

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
particularly around twenty

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
is especially concerned to achieve and I wondered whether Keats's use of the

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
term identity was related in any way to Ericsson's and the more I thought about it the

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
more these seem to play into one another.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And this then emerged as one of the central themes of my own

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
book would need by definition any artist have to find his own identity.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Yes not only

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
any artist I think but really every young person as he cut some self

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
or from that family as he finishes his schooling as he faces

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
adult life for the first time there is

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
a tremendous inner need to define oneself

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
in relation to the world at large is an independent being but I think it's a

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
particularly crucial problem with the artist because his art in some

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
ways is simply the projection of his identity into his

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
chosen

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
medium and we

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
can see certainly more clearly perhaps in the work of a writer

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
than any other artist what all the problems of

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.000
defining

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
the self. First of all and then projecting it into the art

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
that expresses it could you describe that identity

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
which keeps sound.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Well to borrow a cue from Erickson he suggests that every child in growing

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
up goes through a number of identifications.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
With the significant adults in his environment.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
People whom he admires and who he tries to pattern himself on so that

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
when he finally emerges as a. A person in his own right.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Say at the beginning of his twenty's.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Many of those previous identifications or tentative identities

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
are caught up in and harmonized in the mature identity which is something

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.000
of

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
the whole which is more than the sum of its parts. Now I think that there

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
are three roles three identifications we can see

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
in Keats as he grew up the first.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Was very strong identification with an uncle of his who

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
was a captain in the Marines and especially after the death of keeps

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
his father he served as the pattern of the man that keeps wanted to

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
be and we know from his school days how he had a great reputation

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
for courage

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
and Cuban acidy seems to be modeling himself on

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
the hero. If he wanted to be then at the age of fifteen

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
he had to decide on his career and he chose the profession of

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
medicine which is always astonished Keats's readers at

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
first glance and I think this

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
is another very essential aspect to keep his character a kind

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
of self adding the gating side

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
very tender and sympathetic. Side of his personality which

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
is very much concerned with

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
helping the world with relieving the suffering of

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
mankind and then at the time so

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
about when you turn twenty one when he gave up medicine for poetry.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
His first character as a poet. I think was very strongly modeled on identification with

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Lee Hunt who was the

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
first really great influence among the living poets on him what was the

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
one likely kind of your wellies hunt is very easy to make fun of he

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
was something of a dilettante something of a poser. And who had a

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
rather

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
superficial conception of poetry as a thing of luck

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Joria sensations and sentimental.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Situations and this brought out a great deal of

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
the worst of Keats's early poetic make of

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
the little incident which I think precipitated Keith's

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
break with is rather characteristic. Hunt always

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
like sonnet writing contests and one evening he suggested to Keats that

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
they make themselves a laurel crowns like the ancient poets

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and sit with these crowns on their heads and write sonnets

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
on what they

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
felt and Keats did it immediately afterward had a

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
strong revulsion against all that kind of posturing as a poet.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And he said there's

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
no greater sin after the seven deadly than to fool yourself

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
into the idea of being a great poet. So with this break with

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Hunt the early character of the poet that he had assumed was

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
I think submerged or shrugged off and I think we can see in

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.000
the year

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
that followed something rather extraordinary

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
happening. Which can be traced in the end a jury of his poetry a

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
great many images of his poetic career

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:30.000
as

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
a journey of exploration across uncharted seas.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Or as a battle as a great exploit like climbing a

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
mountain come out and I feel that this shows something of the sense of the

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
heroic endeavor that was part of

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
the sense of himself he

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
got from identification with his naval uncle then

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
still more gradually there's another element that enters into his poetry and that is. As

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
you describe. That in the fall of Hyperion the poet as physician to all

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
men. And the primary responsibility of the poet

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
he sings is to take on the sufferings of the world to face them

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
and somehow or other to present them to mankind in a way that they

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
can meet and

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
reconcile themselves to so gradually I think we see all these

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
three previous elements of his personality merging

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
into harmony which is the mature kids.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Didn't Keats in his poetry triumph over the tragic events of his life.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:41.000
I

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
feel he did I think this is another one of the extraordinary It seems

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
that we can trace in his life as it illuminates his poetry. There are

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
a number

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
of minor themes in his poetry that are interesting

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
to isolate there's a great deal of concern with sickness and

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
health noticeable in his imagery. There's also a scene that

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
recurs a number of times in his poetry it changes each

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
time he presents it but it is either that of the

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000
dead

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
awakening or of. A beautiful and beloved woman caught just

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
at the moment that she dies and

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000
the look of recognition fades from her eyes. This.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
I think is very closely related to what we know was the

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
central emotional experience of teachers life and that is the death of his mother when he was

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
fourteen he was very deeply devoted to his

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
mother and during her last illness of tuberculosis.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
He used to take the part of nursing her and he cooked

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
her meals or gave her medicine he read to her he watched all night by her bedside.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And I think that this

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
memory of. Or dying.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And then

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
the kind of dream one often has afterward

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
of the dead person coming to life again is

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
quite an interesting clue to this constant thing the minimum

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
or this is the dead coming to life living dying that

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
we find throughout his poetry in so far you as he was able to face that and

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:27.000
transmute it I think he

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
did achieve his

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
own task of being physician to all men as he called

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000
the poet.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
So the conflict between being a doctor and doing tangible good for

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
humanity and then making beautiful verses which certainly has

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
no manifest indirect benefit was resolved in his mind. I think so

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
in so far as the most

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
beautiful most during the greatest of his

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
poetry is always consumed with this theme of the

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
inevitable suffering and death of human

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
experience and how does one come to terms with it.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
To what degree do you feel Keats. Reached an identity and achieve

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
good at what point in his like did this come.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
This of course is a matter of speculation but

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
I feel that that letter to his brother

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:35.000
George of April eighteen nineteen in which he describes in some detail.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
The process of what he calls soul making of finding an

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.000
identity. Is as clear an indication that he had reached.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
This goal which previously he thought he as a poet

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
would never attain this means I think that he came

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
to terms with the suffering with the uncertainties

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
with the inevitable limitations of his. Own

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
life at about this time. We had only about eight more months in

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000
which to write

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
poetry and not quite two more years to

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
live he didn't write anything after

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
he fell ill in February eight hundred

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
twenty he had finally committed himself to his love for Fanny

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Brawne and was shouldering the responsibilities that

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
this involved chiefly of deciding how he

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
could make enough money to marry

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
her and this

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
meant to reconcile himself to the prospect of returning to medicine. It

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
was necessary giving up poetry. He gave himself. One more chance

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
the summer of eighteen nineteen to see whether he could break through and become a

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
successful poet and of course he

00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:00.000
failed. But he was willing to take the risk knowing what was involved.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
What was the nature of it teaches relationship to Fanny Brawne was it

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
ever one that was filled and

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
sustaining here again we have to

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
speculate some because Keats was

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
very reticent to tell anybody

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:19.000
about

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
this love affair and the only thing we have to go on

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
are is his letters to Fanny Brawne.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Not all of which either have survived.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
She was a young lady of good

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
family. Which meant of course that she had a mother who was

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
concerned that she make a good

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
match and I don't think Keith was ever comfortable in the row

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
of fiancé. There's been a great deal of speculation about whether

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000
she was even the right woman for him. I think she was she had a tremendous amount

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
of vitality and this was what Keats was essentially

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
looking for a girl with a fire. In her heart like mine

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
as he described it once she was very beautiful at least so Keats

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
thought and this mattered

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
tremendously to him she was also quite intelligent as we can

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
gather from her own letters to keep his younger sister Sandy Keats

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
and more than that I think she had extraordinary insight

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
into human beings great courage great command over her

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
own emotions which comes out. Really magnificently during the months and keeps

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
his illness and following his death so far as

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
the satisfactions of their love affair I don't think there were very

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
many he was kept on probation for a long time

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
to prove whether he could in fact support

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
her. I'm sure that the physical

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
contact between them was something fairly rigorously chaperoned the worst

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
thing in the whole terrible exile from England was

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
leaving Fanny as he said to Brown in a letter after he

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
left. I should have had her when I was unhealthy and I should have

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
remained Well I can bear to die I cannot bear to leave her.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
He seemed to resist his love for her for in the in the early stages when I

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
was as

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
well. Keats had several reasons for

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
being quite wary in his relations with women one of them he was

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
very keenly aware of and that was his short height. Remembering

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:36.000
that people

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
were shorter then than they are today still

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
he was only five foot one and that put him at a

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
real disadvantage with most women he felt that he

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
was physically insignificant. And that no woman he

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
ever loved could quite love him in the same

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
degree. He also had. Suspicion which comes

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
out in several extraordinary letters he wrote on the subject there was something not quite

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
right in his feelings about women and this had its roots deep

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
in his

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
past. For us today it's very easy to see how

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
this was related to his feelings about his

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
mother keep his father died when he was only eight suddenly in an accident

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
and she waited less than two months to

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
remarry. And I don't think we need to

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
be trained psychologist to know what a shock that

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
was to a boy of eight then that second marriage was a

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
failure and Mrs Keats went off then this is Jennings in mysterious disgrace

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
for several years. And did not return to her

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
family until she was already

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000
ill so that Keats had

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
very mixed feelings about her this great

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
love this anger at her betraying him

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
and leaving him and then of course the overwhelming experience he had

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
of nursing her in her last illness and not being able to save

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
her and I think that that sense

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
that loving a woman was really a very dangerous thing never quite

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000
left him.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
You can never quite trust. A woman and particularly a

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
woman like Sandy Braun who seems in many ways to resemble his

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
mother fellow vitality loving

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000
pleasure and beautiful as

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
it seems keeps his mother also was this I think we can

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
understand may have been the one of the sources

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
of her attraction for him in the first

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
place with all of the difficulties that Keats faced his

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
parents dying financial insecurity undersell love. Fanny

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Brawne Did he ever doubt himself as a poet.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:11.000
This is a really interesting question. He had to battle his way up.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:17.000
As a poet first before he was even recognized by Hunt.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Not at all sure that he had it in the him to become a

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
poet with the writing say of the sonnet on chap and Homer

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
which everyone realized immediately was a really great sonnet. Then

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
I think the possibility of future

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
achievement became really Actual to him

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000
and even though the first little volume of poems published in eight

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
hundred seventeen was a failure.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
He still felt that he could do

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000
something great in any and and I think it was an extraordinary shock to

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000
him that he fell so far below his own aspirations in that

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000
poem and then the reviewers should have slaughtered it so

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000
immersive fully but he had enough

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
belief in himself to go on writing as he

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
said at the time starting Hyperion which was also the time that the

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000
terrible reviews of Endymion came out I think I shall be among the English poets after my

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000
death. Recognition would come in time of the terrible

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
thing is that as his

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
illness advanced and his third volume of poems came

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
out with the unfinished Hyperion in it he came to suspect

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
that he hadn't achieved anything. That he had hoped

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:47.000
to that he would simply be remembered as the protege of.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Leigh Hunt's the pet lamb in a sentimental force as he called it.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
And in his last months he wanted completely to be forgotten as a

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
poet you think this is result of his own self doubts or of the. The extremely

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
critical reviews that he had been receiving are combination.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Probably a combination I think he was emotionally vulnerable to the

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000
reviews in his illness if he had not been during his

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000
health

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
but what he says in a very beautiful and

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000
moving letter to

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Fanny a month or two after his

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000
illness began.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000
If I should die said I to myself I have left no immortal work behind me

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000
nothing to make my friends proud of my name but I have

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
loved the principle of beauty in all things and if I had had

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
time I would have made myself

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
remembered then

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
I think he lost that stoic sense

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
of resignation and

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000
who is a failure and it was in the

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000
last month or two as he was dying in Rome that he asked his friend

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Severn that his name not been grave on his tombstone as

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:07.000
it is

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
not simply the words after a long preface Here

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
lies one whose name is written in water.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000
And he wanted no notice of this death put in the newspapers no

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:26.000
engraving made of any portrait of me wanted his name completely to be forgotten.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
How was he to take for his literary reputation to establish itself

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
more than twenty years he died in eight hundred twenty one in the first full

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000
length biography came out in eighteen forty eight and this was the thing

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000
that rescued Keats from oblivion. But it did seem

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
for the two decades after his death of his own prophecy

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
was going to be realized that he would be completely

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000
forgotten within his many friends and acquaintances and the intellectuals of the time really

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
didn't serve much to help his reputation. Kept

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
alive no unfortunately keeps was still identified as

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000
the protege of hunt in the minds of the public

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000
and this meant that people were not only suspicious

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000
of his poetry is being a kind of poetry they really couldn't understand

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
or couldn't approve of.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
But they were also suspicious of his political

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000
principles and my news acquaintances were people like Hazlitt Woods worse and Shelley.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
What do you feel he learned from his contemporaries What influence did they have of poetry.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
He learned a great deal from Wordsworth even

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000
though when he got to know Wordsworth personally he had quite

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000
a dismal losing experience. Words with by that time with middle

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000
aged reactionary.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
Egocentric and seemed in every way different from

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
the ideal poet who Keats had imagined him to be.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000
I think it's a. Testimony to keep his generosity of

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
spirit and he was able to rise above

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
that personal experience and

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000
to reaffirm his belief that Wordsworth was the greatest

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000
poet of the times with Shelley and afraid there was a

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:24.000
temperamental difference from the start that was just about completely unbridgeable.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
Shelley unconsciously patronised

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000
Keats and Keats in his pride reacted very strongly against

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
that I think Keats also had a sense that they were very

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
different in their poetic games and practices.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Has led is the chief electoral

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
influence Keats and many

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000
of Keats is

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000
really searching

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
meditation's life on poetry can be traced

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000
back to. Some. Original

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000
intellectual stimulus from Hazlitt for instance that term identity

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000
which enters into Keats's

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000
letters at many points and gradually emerges as one of his very

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
central preoccupations is a term that he borrowed from Hazlitt's philosophy though

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
he does use it in a very significantly different way from has let

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000
himself miswired what place do you feel keep tolls in English letters.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
I think that.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000
As long ago as one hundred twenty one the hundred anniversary of. Keep his death

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
he had one in everybody's estimation a central place in

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:46.000
English poetry as Matthew Arnold had said I think it was eight hundred eighty.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000
He is he is with

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000
Shakespeare. Perhaps this is claiming too much for a poet

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
who really died as his career was just beginning. I think that

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Shakespearean quality that Arnold claimed for Keats is something we

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000
do recognize even though.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Keats never had the fully

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
rounded creative career that Shakespeare did and

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
I think it's significant that during the years since nine hundred twenty

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
one as romantic poetry has gone under a critical cloud keeps

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000
was one poet who remained unquestioned

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000
as a great craftsman a great poet and I think

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
the contribution of the new critics to our reading of Keats is

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000
to make us more fully aware than ever

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000
before of

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
the very great art of his poetry as

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000
well as of course the essential heroism of the

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000
spirit is what I wonder what you feel the relevance of the life of

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000
a genius is to those of us who are not great artists.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000
I think the

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000
story of how Keats. Discovered his the location.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000
And made himself into a poet is one with

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.000
great meaning for all of

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000
us whether we have ever longed to be creative person or

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:24.000
not that sense of coming to terms with one's self.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
That is involved in this achievement of identity of

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
realizing what one's past has been what one's unrealised

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000
potentiality still are what can be

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.000
done to

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000
take these. Givens and these possibilities

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:51.000
of one's own life and work them together into.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000
Significant

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000
envision significant achievement.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000
This is something that everybody in some measure or other must

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000
face in his own life is a

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
challenge and the story of how Keats met that challenge in

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.000
his own life. I think is a heroic

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000
deeply moving and meaningful one for us all is what I want

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:18.000
to thank you

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000
very much for your book on Keats and for this interview.
