00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Thank you for this in the laboratory.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I do also because I turn the machine

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
on

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
at the notes and kind of the sound of the spark at the other day What was I don't forget their cover

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
for the pay

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
of his this is true it's gone on a

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
thirty Republican joke.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Hello I'm on the way to the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
airport with Bob Hope you will impersonate Bob

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Hope I think no further introduction is necessary.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Mr Hope I won't ask you to begin

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
with there lot of people that have a very highly vent developed sense of humor.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
What is it to make somebody become a comedian by profession.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Well I think experience is a great part of it

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
because when you've been in show business long enough to meet all kinds of audiences I think

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
that's where you develop all

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
facets of comedy timing editing

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and delivery which I noticed last night at this is a

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
testimonial dinner that we did for two a chore. I notice a fella called Bob Considine that you

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
know very well great columnist and you'd never dream that

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
he had a sense of timing but I heard some of the nicest timing and

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I graduate them last night after the dinner he did such a

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
wonderful job. Well is this is what is a very important elements in his time in Co

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Yes What do you what about timing just as it sends

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
the audience and how long the waiter

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
or yes to change not exactly how long to wait because they're waiting for

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
you and if you if you notice

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
how Jack Benny makes an

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
audience where they're waiting for the punch line you know that's a. Different other another kind

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
of timing of course of a lot of people don't work as a as slow as Jack but Jack is

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
the is the master of the abating an audience and building it up to where

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
they're anticipating the G.O.P. because they're laughing almost before he gets to the punch line.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
We used those to wait almost longer than any other

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
comedians and no I'm not no Jack is the Jack is the all time a long

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
way to long take as we say I say most comedians can milk a joke

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
but he can get chicken fat out of this. I know that at the Palladium in

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
London that was a great

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
story where Phil Harris in a deuce Dimon said the theory is Jack Benny and just

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
they applauded and when Jack came out he said to Phil thanks very much that introduction feels that that's all right.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
He looked at the audience said I'll do anything to get this old man

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
over and. Jack stared at him and glared at him and then looked at

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
the audience the audience screamed and Jack glared

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and stared and glared and stared and finally got a second back he looked down and said

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
For God's sake say something which I think is so great because Jack I think

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
there's holes alas as long as great as

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
anybody will let you know I understand that you have been right here that

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
you pay up the hundreds of thousands of dollars in here tonight material I sure do. I sure do and I

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
don't have enough sometimes when know if this is the case why could not if I

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
paid writers say you know five hundred thousand dollars you want to not be like Bob.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Well I don't know whether you'd know how to what to added or what to want or

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
are after you got it how to deliver it. That's the whole trick because there are so many wonderful

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
young comedians around now who are you know you think are

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
ready for their own television series and somebody writes him a good script and they

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
go on and they do a pretty good

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
pilot and they go on and they're good for a couple of shows but it takes comedy

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
mines and you'll notice behind every show that there is some great editor

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
or some good comedy mine like Dick Van Dyke. Francis who I think is a

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000
bright

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
young comic and has a guy called. Carl Reiner behind him who is also a

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
very able in a

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
wonderful comedy mind helping him you know that's that's the important part is an

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
awful lot. Do you have endurance to Laurie are you the I'm the editor and so

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
the so essentially it's a matter of knowing what material to pick out of this great body will get it always right or

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Oh sure. No I want to begin then right now and then

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
this man early on when you produce and when you produce like I think all these

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
fellows to do the half hour comedy show or the

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
our comedy show every week should be decorated by the government they really

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
should for a great job of entertaining the people and the bringing

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
the people laughs which we need in this

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
world and I would never attempt that next year I'm going to host a

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
series on our show but I'm just going to host that I'm going to be the center Hitchcock next

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
year and but putting together a

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
comedy show like Jack Benny For

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
instance I mean is a tremendous job and requires a lot of know

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
how you know what the what you think of the younger comedians

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
have come along come along they often the called the

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
sick comedians that Lenny Bruce and

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and many others that are and there are many others. Well they're they're

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
too kind to the yes to

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
comedians mainly Lenny Bruce and sick jokes that have been around and then there's

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
a Mort Sahl and and Elaine May Mike

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Nichols Shelly very well always Oh you're all I know you know I did I say the

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
satirical comedian has always been with us and these people that you mention a marvelous not Lenny Bruce is really

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
sick and it's sad because the second always and he is one I

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
thought was going to develop into one of the finer comedians Kizzy he's got a

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
great knowledge of show

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
business and unfortunately he got off on the wrong track because he was one of my

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
favorite guys and I'd like to see him get well mentally and physically

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
and get into our business and really. Make a contribution cap because he

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
can you think he's gone over the line in terms of being well I thought well he's actually

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
not money is not well let you know it's not it's not anything to joke

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
about and he's about the he's really sick

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000
you know yeah yeah. Not just his motive of humor.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
How serious a purpose do you think humans should have to point

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
out things that should be made fun of

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and you take the content very

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Here you have to you have to walk

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
the case line there that all the time you know like for instance you talk

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
about it was in the paper that Mrs Kennedy was expecting and I did a

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000
big routine about

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
it on my show last week and it

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
and I received no complaints out of our audience you know which we

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000
think is rather large and must be because otherwise I'm stealing a lot of money.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
So in other ways you can take any counting anything in almost anything and do it with case or taste right.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
But to do you are you concerned about pointing out things that are wrong in

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
the society or things that are third

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
in official places and

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
with authority this kind of

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
thing where I think in these terms. Yes I think in all terms and I just I I

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
stay away from things that I think will love to provoke it if I like

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
to I like I'm I'm merely in this business for the last and it's

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
a it's not to be provocative and hurt

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
anybody and so I said I steer away from anything I think will injure

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
anybody is using the most human this thing in the world to talk about what makes something funny but you have any ideas

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
of what it is that makes something amusing.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Oh sure what is it. Well it's a it's it's like this you know this is a

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
kind exaggeration of what we're doing in the back car you know back here and we're

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
taping on the way to the airport when we really should be sitting in a nice quiet.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Spot on the hotel this is this is almost

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
like this is going to be funny with you know here we are with cars

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000
streaming by and they should be laughing but they're just driving.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
We're running away from our audience at this speed.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
So the so is it and soon all the you know minute duration.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Yes that's right. And there's it's tearing down dignity as

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
it is another form of comedy. You know and there's so many

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
ways that you can as so many facets of comedy.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Do you work on a joke. Do you shape it in front of audiences and make it come alive

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
sure we play around with it right that the best time like last night we were

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
at this testimonial

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
and Jim Farley was sitting there who has been connected with Coca-Cola for years

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:49.000
you

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
know and I said to just happen to think that there is Jim Farley who

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
is Coca-Cola as an answer to Joan

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Crawford you know and her and usually jokes

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
that people have to think about a little are the best kind of jokes. They catch on. Yeah

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
and president of Fordham father McKinley was there and I'm sure the Sterling to see him

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
here he's such an influential man. The only man I know could get into this ballroom without a

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
tie and those are those are the kind of things that you

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
shape right there the same know that you're you're you're making

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
up and you have got to be very angry at you if you're making a joke about them in

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000
their presence.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Very few very few

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
times you know I usually try to steer away from anything like

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
that but you started working with him in Florida building you how does

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
that compare to the kind of routines you do now

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
is there about the same. I've always worked along the lines I've always

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
tried to be

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
semi pseudo

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
subtle have an audience

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
think that I'm I'm doing settlement area which really is you know that they

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
get and because an audience likes to be.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
They like to they like to be thinking like a little quiz going with a joke all the time you know.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
So there's they're really show is showing that they're pretty smart when they last right.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
But they enjoy it if they have to look for it yourself as the level of audiences just occasion increased over

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000
the years in Arundel

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
days canary much so on and how they've been educated through the you know the television on the

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000
radio and now every

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
year every house has their own picture show you know where the furniture

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
with the building popcorn in the whole thing and they've got to know more

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
about showbusiness and they get so many jokes thrown at them through the week. You know all so many shows

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
of that they're all educated and there's no more sticks or all

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
just one big community that used to be where you go and I on they were

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
the sticks they know right now just what Gordon Cooper did and they know what we said

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
last night here because it was on T.V. and it went right to

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000
them and they were listening they probably in they know more about it than anybody I heard a very cute thing last

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
night so I plan to lobby you know Cooper when he was up there he was supposed to have said that

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
he could look down and see his place where he lives you know and this little boy he process. He

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
probably said get that car out of the

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
driveway which is you know the head and the eyes of

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
the funny

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
little do you practice on your

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000
children all the

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
time with a good audience a very good and they're great. They're great that having the other ones

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
you know when I want to want to find out about a job they're very fast

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
to as well and probably very critical. They are in all of them their

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
murder not polite a bit I would know now that you were

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
that there were some the critics however when you travel around the world and

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.000
it's helped you find that senses of humor different in different countries.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Well that's that's understandable can actually the English audiences are I think of the best audiences in the

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
world are very eager to understand our jokes and

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
they're they're just waiting. You know I can the

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
best audience just as like at the platy I'm in London you can't find a better audience than that because they come

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
in laughing they're laughing when they're But when they buy the ticket and they

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
want they want to understand their way to a little ahead of time. The faster Saudis

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
or how about the New York audiences.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
They're great they're really great.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
I find very little difference and audiences them to the same jokes play

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
in New York to play in Chicago in London and same thing everybody's got the same set

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000
of you

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
know have you played audiences in in the countries and speak a

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000
foreign

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
language here and I think yes. How does that work is that every little thing that's a little different things

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
yeah I did a show for the in Brussels for

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
the for the

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Belgium newspaper people and I only knew a

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
few words of French. So I had to bring in an interpreter you know and I was a little

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
rougher because he got most of the laughs and usually what they interpret

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
say they leave out of order or something and it doesn't just I was funny

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
and there's no I know I have trouble speaking the French language and I'm trying to something funny in it

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
and it is rather murderous just because you were I guess it's timing is all mine. It's

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
just a really rough. How do you feel

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
about developments

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
abroad in terms of the way that America is thought up is our country

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
is always the ugly Americans are we.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
How we received abroad. I think they're very jealous

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
of us and a lot of a lot of countries and it's where the rich relatives you

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
know that never is a very popular position all and we've got to stay that

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
way out of the

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
parcel and and naturally we we've been giving him all

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
money and so you know how relatives react when they get money they want

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000
more and they're

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
jealous but there's been no animosity towards you presume you don't feel like

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
this American no no but I made a mistake in Paris six. Earlier years ago because I was

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
driving with a French chauffeur who understood English was a regulatory

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
chauffeur over there and I said gee I

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
said I forgot I think his name

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
was Marcel I said Marcel and you have been America and he said No

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
I have not I said well I said America is the greatest country in the were and I thought he was going

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
to run me into a bus.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
They're already dangerous drivers you unknowns

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
a greatest country in their words this is to prove that they went up in the alley with this

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:40.000
fat Buick and send me out a little. Funny thing Chrysler I'm sorry.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:40.000
He

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:47.000
said I'm with Chrysler you know.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Put it will put the plug in there let's cut that I guess

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
that's what we get we can cut we can any of this out so that's

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
good good.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
The job is there any

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
political administration isn't much more easy to

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
to make jokes about than others how do you feel about the candidates in the

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
state they're marvelous you know I got a call on for my show was

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
on Wednesday and I got a call on

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Thursday morning from operator eighteen Washington D.C. I was in Palm Springs the White House calling.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
So I thought when I'd done a few jokes about Mrs

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Kennedy expecting everything I'd been doing all around the country and I knew they were in good

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
taste because I had received no

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
plans but I called back and it was Mrs Ted Kennedy asking me if I

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
was going to do a show for the twenty seven Project Hope show that they're putting on a strong

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
team and she said well I just want to tell you that we saw the show last

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
night and we just how we thought it was a great is you know that's just

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
marvelous and they seem

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
to have. Better. You know that they receive these jokes. Or than anybody that had

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
a better sense of humor than anybody and I

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
was marvelous you know I could like all agog jokes and of course I still play with springs

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:09.000
every once in awhile when

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000
I get the chance to play with him because he's such a wonderful man

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
and he just loves he just loves humor they all of you Mr Truman was great

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Mr Roosevelt just loved loved you so they're good sports. They are

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
they're marvelous. A couple of finer broadminded to you know they've got to be big

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
people to be in that position. They love it and they appreciate

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
it have any jokes of that made about you that you know and across

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
be said some pretty nasty been the

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000
comedians that you've been marred the most. Well I've been marred a lot of comedians of course Fred Allen was one

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000
of my favorites the late Fred Allen and Jack Benny. I love Jack Benny I enjoy him

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000
very much and I love that wild man Jonathan Winters. I think he's

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:55.000
really

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
imaginative. Do you really do you read comic books very

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
much comic books come at work. Oh no I am

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:05.000
so

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
busy reading scripts and different things that I don't I don't have too much chance by the time I read

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
things I have to you know for my show and for my different things I don't have too much

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000
chance to read

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
you want to I mean we hear What We Can

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Do you

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
know who you know we go you know I'm going to Springfield

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
this one

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
assume you're really serious about Julia's not

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000
always we will save for this program that I

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
wasn't sure he did say so we're going

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
to that's very nice of you we'll get you on the

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Yes on the tape

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
to those wondering I thought maybe this is a bus terminal but I really thought

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
it was over doing in there so I thought maybe he had a has a kind of a walk here anyway.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Oh I see how that was. Was winding up the

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
interview I thought it was the first thirty

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
minutes or so so we got quite

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:09.000
a ways to go yet have

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000
we can we can we play on the tape or do you want

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000
to cut this because then I can edit it and keep Party and all that but that's

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000
marvelous because I was I was a skipping over because we thought we was a most

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Laureus God of course effort to

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:39.000
learn new ways.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:39.000
I

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
want to. Not just doesn't have to be on the take

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000
but if you have any feelings that maybe you don't want to talk about about just what's going

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
on our country versus Russian Communism and space race and some of

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.000
the greater absurdities of what is going on can we get into some of that are you why don't you go.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000
OK

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
fine how do you feel this joke about this

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
race for the moon what is your is this something that we should be doing or or not.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Well you know I've heard a lot of pros and cons about this and

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000
I feel that there's scientifically I am for the

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000
future of the world I guess we have

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000
to continue in this race and I know it's it's called a

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
spending its money is called keeping up with a crucial House.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
But it's it's it's quite a question and I guess we have to do

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
it I guess there's a if

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000
we're going to the moon. I mean if we got to have parking space I guess

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000
we better continue on that and that right.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Have

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
you ever thought of taking a trip up there.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Well I've I have I've always thought of going that way but not while I was alive.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000
How about the the many movies you've made the road to Mandalay road to about as many

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
many places. Why so many. The you like this one

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000
that the

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000
road probably only run the reason we kept you on the road because they were very

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
very commercial and

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000
very funny and they worked out so great you know it's a successful format is just like

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000
doing our show every week we keep doing it because we've had three we have requests for it and those

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
are the biggest money makers we remain I'd like to make another one. What's the next place you

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
want to get well we want. My dear oh dear

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000
India how can you enjoy working

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
with movies. I do very much.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Hi Joy all of this. Otherwise I wouldn't be in and I'd be a definite golf

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
pro not good but I'd bet that it would be my next

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000
move would he done if you were the comedian.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Well I think that I would be in some form of you know show business.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000
I'd be producing here and I think if I was out of that I'd be in maybe in the

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
restaurant business I'd enjoy that you know another public relation would you ever go into politics

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.000
or diplomacy will I ever do it will never think of doing that well ironically choice.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
I doubt it I might have been thrown into that angle but

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
I had never had any idea of

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000
what actually led you into the field this is this in the family I was a very lucky as my mother was a concert

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000
singer and my dad was sort of an amateur comedian and I developed a sense of humor

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000
and when I was young and started dancing and singing and telling jokes.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
I found out that I could tell jokes and get to last with an audience

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
and I was on the way I just considered you always

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
very confidentially to news in the beginning

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
that you know I don't I'm a I was a pose I don't think that I don't think that I was all that

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
stuff and I'm not I'm not confident today as late as last night I was sitting there

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
wondering whether you know this material that I had for this dinner would

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
would play with this particular group I don't think you can ever become

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
confident because I think that

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
I would be a dangerous position to be and I think you have to keep. Thinking

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
people keep talking

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
to people now when I get a routine France if I'm doing an academy award show or call of three or four of

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.000
my friends that I know have a sense of humor and I'll just sort of feel I'm

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
out about certain jokes and get their reaction you

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000
know right. Implies you did a very good job with Apple and that's a tough thing

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:19.000
to do with

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000
the Academy Awards it sure is because you're fine to a critical audience a right front of

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000
you even though there are friends and everything but they're they're very show wise they know all

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000
the answers and everything and you have to come

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
up with something a little different little sophisticated.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000
How about television do you have freedom there to do pretty much what you want yes I do.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
How do you explain your long life in television when so often good programs go

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000
off one world I think we covered that in the first part it's a matter of

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000
knowledge and knowing what the audience wants in the editing sense.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000
You see one when you have a

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000
staff and they are they bring in material you have to

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000
know whether this particular piece of material or

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000
play or how to be received whether it's good taste

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000
and that's the that's the trading value that knowing what you do any have to produce it and get

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000
it on right you know you

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
know you ever wanted to act in

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000
serious roles is it saying that most comedians want to play Hamlet

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000
a result

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000
of that no I don't have to have the desire because a lot of my comedy is pretty

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000
serious I go and let everyone

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.000
know what about the saying that that comedians off stage

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
is very melancholy does this apply to

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000
you No

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000
no no I care there's no way because a people are always walking up and telling me

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000
jokes and so it's a funny joke last night about this

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000
New York Allo join the Peace

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000
Corps and when she came back she had one of

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000
these witch doctors with a bone through his nose and everything

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000
and better. A mother at the dock and the mother said No no I met a

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:14.000
rich doctor.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:14.000
I

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000
was

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000
really

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000
confident over that job last night you know Miller and you know

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000
I I there's no way I can keep away from comedy because people walk right up

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
and laugh in my face.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Can you a huge joke like that in your

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000
routine three people oh my you

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000
never get in trouble with somebody using your material

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000
and claiming that you use theirs.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Well no more no more use to and thought of it all is they say that you

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000
know they had that job before because jokes play back in the subconscious and you'll

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000
switch him and bring him out another way and I remember the

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000
original I was wondering about that you hear the same is it just seven basic plots

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000
and seven basic jokes and also true

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000
variations actually on a news

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000
event will bring out a new situation you know

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000
a fresh new thing like the space

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
thing if we really got sound effects

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000
of this we can do that a little drama like it's the horn blowing

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000
at certain times of the brink

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000
of doing well and it was a great crash you're sure and you say oh I have a

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:32.000
little you want to do the second to your lies.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000
We're going to policemen the Colossus a mr all yours made a

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
good

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000
one you're doing very

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
well but we were just

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000
about

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000
people feeling the fury of about

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
the seven. You know the basic you're going to say that you get

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000
something political types

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000
and like the space shuttle.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Oh you can say that I said a fresh news event would bring on for instance a new plot that they've

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:07.000
never heard

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000
of but you handled it in pretty much one

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.000
of several ways in

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000
which you know you and I relate a lot here in this in this last show of ours Francis corporate went up.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000
We had our show take a week before and in the middle of the week.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Cooper went up you know and had this wonderful

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000
trip and I was so worried that our show it to be stale and then I

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000
remembered that luckily Fred MacMurray was doing

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
a spaceman sketch where he opened up a sleep

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000
in this capsule. Which was unbelievable because it looked like we wrote it that they did you see the

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000
movie and it was just it just fit and then I had it all and I

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000
said this is my last show of the season that only means one thing on my house

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000
countdown at the unemployment here. You know which is also tied into a group or you are so

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000
lucky you find it does a difficult when you make your tapes of topical if they've

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000
been dating you can't be well I had a

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
little oh I have to run in every once in a while and

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000
do a hot monologue or something real important happens and you have to

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000
comment like if a cruise ship starts banging his foot on the desk you

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000
know I have to run in and you know

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000
are just just doing new monologue because they expect

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000
it and they criticize me if I don't because I'm We keep you know

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:31.000
so oppressed to the news that they expect that if something big happens.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000
They want to comment on they want they want to hear something.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000
Do you have any favorite political figures that you like to take off or can you

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:40.000
just

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000
about know we just we just do the boys on top you know

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000
our president. Mr Gold or

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000
Mr

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000
Rockefeller plenty of material less than a material or because you know on

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000
the Seraph I got there and we just plain they were searching for another

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
vote and nasty little things like.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000
We say the wonderfully good in the White House because of

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000
the Great to see those gas pumps on the White House

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000
lawn should be a joke. What is that what about the statement

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000
that Americans are losing a sense of humor that the younger generation is serious or not people are coming

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:17.000
more

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000
standardized it's not true laughing just

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000
as great all over the country I just finished touring all over the country I played a

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000
high University in Athens I played Cincinnati

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.000
university played Chicago Cleveland two or three

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000
shows on the spot and they're wonderful.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
When do you like to travel you would you do that just because you know I like

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.000
to stay in Palm Springs and plague office when but I I'm such a ham and

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000
I get stuck into these things when your friends ask you to do certain

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000
things to get stuck into a project and you want

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000
to post and Tupac

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
would say that but you do if you

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000
do I don't know yet if you're in show business.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.000
You kind of get the feeling that you have to help things like you make a picture and I say

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000
but when you go to New York and play a couple seers with Lucy and you think that I'll be fun we'll do it

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000
so that's what we did last weekend we played nineteen theaters

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000
in three days. That's pretty good if you're really in showbiz

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
particularly when you're in deep like to get that blood back to

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000
Joe

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000
I've want to close a final question do you have a favorite

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000
joke a favorite joke

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000
yeah I have it on favorite

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000
show you tell us one favorite joke for the

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000
club and I mean I mean that's true but one is not too topical by the way

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
to make a play later.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000
Sure say the rich Dr Just think

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000
of

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000
a lot

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000
of things which. As

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:00.000
a

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000
good

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:24.000
good

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000
psychic you think we're good clean one

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000
to get me off the S.S. Thanks a lot.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000
This is a

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000
crazy

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000
because

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:52.000
it's

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
such a know if this goes on with Genesis one

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000
that you can understand alright. I can't

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000
because

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000
it's my favorite joke. First of

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.000
all when I told last night about the gods for the want to make it

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:14.000
but you gotta it's got a punchline that I don't think is just good for the world if you go around the world you go around

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:14.000
the world with

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
this you know this goes to good

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000
in Europe and Latin America. That's where they pretty much

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.000
know but also that's in the news a

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.000
lot but you

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000
know that you know that one of my favorite jokes about the about the

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.000
foursome that's playing and the other one fella dies on the night screaming drops dead of a

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000
heart attack and they have to bring him back to the clubhouse they're all sitting around having a drink trying to forget this

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:46.000
terrible incident and all the members are walking over to console him and said What a

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
terrible thing to experience this must have been for

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.000
him and that they had another drink and thought about it at once so I said gee the

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000
worst part must have been carrying him back to the clubhouse and one of the members of

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000
the foursome said no the worst part was putting him down and picking him up between

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:09.000
shots in the gulf your favorite.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000
Thank you very much doubt with this interview

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.000
