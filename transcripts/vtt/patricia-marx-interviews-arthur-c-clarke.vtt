00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Appreciate my arts interview each week at this time your city station bring to an interview with a

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
leading figure in the arts politics or the sciences and here now to introduce

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
today's program is Patrice earmarks.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I'm delighted to have is my guest today the same science and science fiction writer Arthur

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
C. Clarke.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Mr Clark is author of Almost forty books which have been printed in some thirty languages and

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
they've sold about five million copies. He's also been awarded many prizes for

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
his science writing and originated the concept of communications

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
satellites. Mr Clarke's most recent nonfiction book entitled The promise

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.000
of

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
space came out this spring. Recently he made his debut as a writer

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
of screenplays by collaborating with the film director Stanley Kubrick on this

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
big tackler M.G.M. film about space

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
exploration in titled two thousand and one A Space Odyssey.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Mr Clark I understand that the screenplay for Space Odyssey was one of the first collaboration

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
you've ever been involved

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
with and I wonder how did this come about.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Well when I had finished. Dr Strangelove Stanley Kubrick became very interested

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
in space and he decided that he would go out into

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
space and he wrote to me it early in one thousand nine hundred sixty

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
four asking if I had any ideas on the subject he'd read a good many of

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
my stories and books by

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
then and he said that he heard I was coming to New

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
York and could get together and discuss a space project and I cast

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
around for ideas that would make a good movie and I thought almost immediately

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
have a short story of mine called The Sentinel which had written out a twenty years

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
ago. And I suggested this to him and we talked it over and.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Expanded this into a complete screenplay and novel.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Of the great number of stories that you've written why did you pick this

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and well I've written and had about one hundred. Short Stories now

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and the sentinel just it was a very short story about the discovery on

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
the moon something would have been buried there millions of years ago by some

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
extraterrestrial visitors. And this is found by explorers by.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Astronauts and it is in fact a kind of burglar alarm which has been deliberately left

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
there to detect the rise of intelligence on

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Earth and when it's detected it sends off a signal and the story

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
of two thousand run radius tracing the signal does to its source to find out who

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
put the thing there and why and why they're interested in

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
us. Why did you see this in terms of this deal.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Well this is this idea is a kind of open ended one you can develop it in almost any direction

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
you see and how you get out of it not only into the future but into the past because a

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
flashback to three million years ago showing how

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
this how in the past does to

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
earth affected our destiny. So there's

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
this longest flashback in the history of movies the dawn of man and

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
then on to the future to what this all leads

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
to can you describe it all the the actual story.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
The Silm contrast since well.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Very briefly the story opens on the moon after

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
this flashback I mentioned with the discovery of this device which is a large object. Birdied

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
X. down knew the stuff of the moon in the great Claytor Tycho and this is rather

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
interesting because we started doing

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
this like in the movie actually shooting at three years ago and only a few months

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
ago the last of the American space probes the surveyor space probes landed on

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
the outskirts of this crater and sent

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
back the first close ups of this crater Tycho the course when we made the movie we

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
had to imagine what it was like in close up and I'm happy to say that we've got

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
away with it. Does look very much like pictures sent back. And the way the

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
story shows the discovery of this NG and it admits a very very powerful

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.000
radio

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
signal. Which every bit of surprise is beamed towards the giant planet

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Jupiter Jupiter is the largest of all the planets. It's eleven

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
times the diameter of Earth's enormous place.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And it's a long way from the sun it's extremely cold a couple of hundred degrees below

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
zero and there's a very deep dense atmosphere of

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
poisonous gases hydrogen ammonia and until recently it was thought absolutely

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
inconceivable that it could be any life there that we now know this is a very naive view

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.000
and then

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
fact you can make a case for Jupiter being a better place for life on the planet Earth and Sun The

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Sun Assad does have. However.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
To get back to the film this main story of the film is an exploration out to

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Jupiter to see where this signal leads

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and out among the ones of Jupiter the real action of the movie starts.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
No is science fiction sixteen in the sense

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
of having being completely fantastic and having no basis in

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
the realm of possibility the possible.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Oh it's entirely science I mean everything in it is factual it could happen. It's based

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
entirely on scientific reality is and we know pains and expense have

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
been spared to make these realistic as

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
possible so you're saying actually that in the year two thousand when

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
this actually might happen.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Well certain the next century. I mean obviously I don't predict that when they get to their own we will find evidence

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
of extraterrestrial life there of higher intelligences But all

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
this kind of thing could happen and eventually something like this I believe will happen. But don't guarantee it

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
will happen in the year two thousand and

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
one o'clock why does it take so long to actually make this. I know it was

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
scheduled for release almost a year ago when you started back in the winter of sixty five.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Why was it so difficult to do.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Well first of all it's

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
not a single scene in this film which takes place on

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
our contemporary world.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
The prologue of three million years ago in the

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
past the future sequences are all in space which means that everything had to

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
be constructed we had to design a spacecraft and we got the best people we

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
could from the space program to do this for us.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
We had to build sets that show conditions on the moon and everything

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
was strange everything had to be designed from scratch and this involves the

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
most tremendous problem remember this isn't Cinerama no one has ever attempted to do this kind of

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
thing on the wide Cinerama

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
screen and a Stanley Kubrick is an absolute perfectionist.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
I mean I've seen rushes which to me look marvelous which but he said they're not good enough and back ago and have to be done again.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And there's another point which I

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
should like to make Now this is the last space

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
film which will not be made on

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
location

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
the startling thought is Well that's the most stopping thought is that when this film is filmed

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Cinerama run men will be landing on the

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
moon. This is really isn't so much fiction in the sense

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
of the way out future.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Well I think in fact we've gone a long way ahead of anything is going to happen in the next couple of decades so

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
it's reality isn't going to catch up with us.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
I know you said about the whole experience working with

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
this to Kubrick and filming the film that was a wonderful experience streaked with agony

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
and what were the agonizing elements.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Well I don't know said that but. Considering the length of the collaboration the

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:59.000
problems involved. It was remarkably trouble free.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
We never came. Blows very sad on this

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
agreed. As far as the storyline is concerned.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
I think there are hardly any points of disagreement and I was like a sort of ping pong match I

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
mean we sort of batted ideas back and forth and at this date I cannot honestly

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
say who is responsible for what in the in the

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
movie this clocking Can you describe what it is that you really wanted

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
to say through the film. What the second. What would

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
you like to accomplish. By making a film like this.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Well rename for a great many things primarily of course as

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
any film must entertainment. So it's not a documentary it's

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
not a sermon is a very exciting story but we also aim to create a sense of

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
wonder. And to convey the beauty and strangeness of the

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
universe to make people realise to get some idea of man's

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
place in the let's say the cosmic hierarchy are

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
we until recently we've tended to think of ourselves as the lords

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
of creation.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
We know now across that the Earth is just one very small planet an enormous

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
universe but this idea although it's accepted intellectually is not yet accepted

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
emotionally and I think this film will help people realise

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:27.000
this we may be quite low in the pecking order of the universe.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
How do you personally except something like this do you find it an insult.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
What is your emotional reaction to insights which is

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
that life find inspirational. The only way you can make progress in any activity

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
and the sport in art and

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
science is to realise the something better than you are someone has done better than you have

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
done and I see nothing I told a grating to think that we are part of

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
a cosmic or an evolutionary process between apes

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
and angels and that we have a long way to go

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
yet. Many

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
people are fascinated with the idea of for

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
instance the defied flying objects in the the existence

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
of intelligent life throughout the

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
universe frequently it's viewed as a threat and is something to be

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
frightened of no what is your attitude towards the intelligent life universe and

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
the the feasibility that will get in contact with

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
it but I think most scientists now do except for

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
the idea that there may be a great deal of life in the universe

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
and a great deal of intelligence and much of this intelligence is probably much more advanced

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
than we are because our a still very young in terms of the age of the stars and the planets we've

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:45.000
only been here

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
for a few minutes of cosmic time.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
So we're probably very primitive.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Now is this a threat. Well

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
if it's hard. It could be in some ways I mean the

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
higher races may look on us much as we look on musky shows us slugs are

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
very mean and who can blame women and some of the things that we've been

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
doing. On the other hand I think that with great intelligence would also

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
grow compassion and understanding. So I do not regard the existence

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
of higher intelligence as a threat myself.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
I'm really likely to make contact with this higher intelligence through

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
actual physical transportation or is it much like more likely to

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
be communication through you

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
like waves or radio and it's this is a subject of a lot of debate many

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
scientists are prepared to admit the idea that. We may make contact

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000
with higher intelligence is through radio if not make contact we

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
may pick up their signals which would tell us that they exist even feed in fact we cannot answer

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000
them

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000
ourselves and these are very

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
interesting observations in radio astronomy quite recently they found some

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
pulsating red. Sauces which is which they have tentatively So that's it may be

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000
an artificial

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
origin something of this man will probably happen. May not happen in the near future but within

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
a few hundred years I feel reasonably confident we will detect

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:21.000
other civilizations. Through their artifacts either through their radio or.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Radio emissions or something like

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
that now most scientists are prepared to admit this but very

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
few as yet are prepared to accept the idea of

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:31.000
actual physical

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
contact because of the stars or such enormous distances from our

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
sun that even light takes many years on the journey and

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
any consists Pede we can imagine with the sort of vehicles we like to

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
build in the next century or so that journeys would take not

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
centuries but thousands or even hundreds of thousands of years.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
So they say space travel to the stars interstellar flight is actually out of

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
the question. Well I don't believe this because we have seen so many apparently

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
impossible barriers reached in the

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
past that I feel confident that the advance of the advance of

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
technology that exists continues even on this earth.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
We'll probably be able to reach the stars. We'll have a technology which would reach the stars in

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:26.000
the fairly near future when I say that had a near future I mean less than two hundred years.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000
You know when you see many scientists would you find on both sides of this argument.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Many scientists taking one side or the other you somewhat I would individual

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
in this know I'm I think very few scientists today except the possibility

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
of physical flights to the stocks but this is

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
changing and recently quite a number have come out in a fire pointing out

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
that we have seen the most fantastic increase of power in speed in the last few decades that

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
it's not reasonable to assume this progress won't fail to continue and if it does.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Than in a couple of centuries should if we wish to be able to go to the stars on the other hand it may

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000
turn out to be so

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
difficult that it isn't worth doing it's much easier to talk our exchange

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
T.V. signals and some people say why do you want to do more than this. If you can talk them and see them.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Why should you want to go there and I think men always want to go where they can go even as difficult and

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
dangerous because it is there. They're the kind of for

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
his but what real impact do you think

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
space travel might have on the on modern civilization

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000
what changes my

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000
me when I think they're going to be profound because space is the great new from here.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
I've been thinking or writing about this for thirty years

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
now and that I have a book called The Promise of space coming up from

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Hopper shortly. Which does great is devoted to this we need this

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
new frontier. We need space for many reasons practical reasons for

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
our new technologies like communications

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000
meteorology and other space industries starting up space even space

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
tourism by the end of the century and then we show a Helton orbiter hotel in

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
two thousand and one and I believe a space tourism is going to begin after all who would have thought

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
of tens of thousands of tourists flying across the Atlantic every

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000
week. Only twenty years ago that were going to the moon in the next century.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
You really see it is that frequent in the argue is this living

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
out in space and make it really relatively unpopular.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Now we're going to develop the solar system over the next year centuries in just the same way

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
that we develop this planet. We're going down into the sea or going out into space.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
We need these from tears we're going to work off I aggressions there. If we didn't have them we'd be

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
doomed if we didn't have this outlet for our

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
activity for our exploring an inquisitive

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
spirit. So in fact you see space and space exploration is the great. Hope for

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
mankind. They are essential their essential physically and also psychologically.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
What is your reaction to the attitude expressed by Louis Munford

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
that space will actually be the death

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
of civilization and that any man that lives out in space is

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
living in a culture as quoted in your book in fact it

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
is compares most unfavorably to the desk old worship of

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000
the

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Egyptians across Louis nonvoters is talking utter

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000
nonsense space.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Spaces beautiful strange one before. All these positive adjectives can be applied

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
to it I mean some of the emotional reactions of the astronauts already and of and

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000
the beautiful films that are being brought

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
back have already shown how ridiculous it is to make this statement which someone

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
for did actually the father was in a space

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
flight and he said we were a lot of mommies traveling

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
out but in fact

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
that the people have been into space being very reluctant to come back some of

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
them. Are you putting yourself to to go into space.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Oh I have every intention of going to the mourners a tourist in my old age.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
What

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
really do you think that you or anyone else

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
within the near future thirty forty fifty years can find they are that

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
we can find on Earth.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Well across the first place we're going to reach the morning and the morning

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000
is of great scientific value because it's going to carry on

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
its surface a record of events to be happening over the last few million years which are lost on the

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
earth that. When and. Whether have Iraq.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Someone once said the morning going to be the earth the Rosetta Stone of the solar system that will carry much of

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
the history of the origin of our world.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000
And anything we can learn about the way our world came into existence is. Gonna be a

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
colossal practical value of a scientific value it may tell us you know where to look

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000
for minerals

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
and so forth.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
There's also a possibility the idea behind the two thousand one a fact that on the one

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
we may find evidence of visits from

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
other civilizations from other creatures. Because if anyone ever came to the earth in the remote policy it is quite

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
possible to be no trace of it now it would have been

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
destroyed on the moon where conditions are probably stable for millions of years. You may

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
find the empty Coke bottles and so far left all that

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
equipment left by visitors. You know over a hands of

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
time. That's one theory for the origin of life business they were kind of the

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.000
refuse to ice travel we were the germs that are brought here in the trash in the trash and.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
This you talk to is as it is down to quite an argument

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
among scientists which is more important to put emphasis on man getting the space

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000
or more highly sophisticated machines

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000
tools apparatus which side do you take in this

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000
argument list is ready and entirely artificial sort of argument we will do whatever can be

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000
done best with machines will be done with machines whatever can be done best man will be done with man.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000
There are many things in many cases where you wouldn't use a man but there are many things which a machine can

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000
do whenever the some kind

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000
of unpredictable events whenever something goes wrong.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
A man can put it right in a second when a machine might not be able to cope a tall. They've been

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000
examples of this already and they've asked us not flights where capsules would have been lost

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
because something that should or happen that a man was able to fix so no trouble a tall. No it's a

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000
perfectly trivial

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000
things that a rogue automatic equipment can't deal with since is the hatch jamming a man will

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.000
say OK Oliver there with a full listen there's something you know which can be programmed.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Moreover man is the best possible observer. You can only

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
design instruments to look for things you expect.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000
And a man

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000
can observe things which no one was expecting and this is well

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000
where scientific advances usually results the unexpected. This

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
is why we need man in

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000
space when in a previous book of yours profiles of the future you

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:23.000
raise the question and the real possibility you. Will man become obsolete.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
What is your thinking about this

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
now. Melissa's looking a good deal further ahead. Now one day we will

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
have robots automatic. Electronic intelligence as which may

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
be superior to mad and then what I've just said may no longer be entirely

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
valid but men will still want to go even if they are accompanied

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:49.000
by robots who may be more intelligent than they are because after all.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000
Men are adventurous men have emotional needs and one of those needs is

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000
her demand for beauty for wonder for

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000
excitement and this is why this is why spaces important altogether apart from its scientific

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000
value will this kind of beauty and excitement be available only to

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
the super elite the highly trained astronaut so do you see this

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000
becoming a democratic movement which is would have an effect on

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
the common man in the world.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000
The same thing is going to happen in space or perhaps not to. Quite such a great

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
extent as happened in aviation and is happening now an underwater exploration

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
a few pioneers at great risk to life and limb go there first and

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000
ultimately becomes the accessible to almost anybody who is prepared to make the

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
effort. And I think in the next century in space travel at least to them alone and probably

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
to Mars and the nearer

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
planets a hundred years from now will be about the same level

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000
as jets. Transportation on this pond is

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000
today so close and it was in the

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000
century first century but look what has happened in the last century and remember things are happening now.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
And accelerating right. When you try to look forward not the art two thousand and one but said the

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000
year two thousand and sixty eight hundred years from

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000
now the change them expecting that century are at

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000
least equivalent to the change of taking part in the last three or four centuries.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:23.000
In fact a century from now in the future is about as far away as Columbus in the past.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Can you describe just briefly what you see could be the

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
major changes when you're talking about a century way.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.000
Well by then of course we all have where you have to have a

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.000
stable political situation on the earth because if we haven't we'll have blown ourselves to pieces

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000
before that so there will be a world society or World

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Federation or

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
something on Earth by then.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000
And the world will be as McLuhan has called it already a

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
global village with instantaneous communication. And no point in earth to be

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000
more than about forty five minutes from A.O.L. at any other point.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000
This isn't physical trends in physical transportation and tenth of a second

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
and electronic transportation

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000
and communication. That will

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
be colonies kind of large

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
ones on the Mall on and Mars will be manned all

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:21.000
betting bases

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000
around Jupiter Venus victory in fact.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000
Probably most of the planets. We will

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
of perhaps send our first automatic space probes heading out towards an era stars.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
So I don't think anyone any will any will have reached the end I think we would have

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000
probably established

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000
contact with extraterrestrial intelligence is that we may not of

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
these from a detector that we may not have started to talk to them.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000
Well you're do you see man himself

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000
be qualitatively different. For instance.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000
The possibility of being connected with. Ingesting

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
learning this kind of thing.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
I think there will be some revolutionary changes in education.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
Perhaps Possibly by that time direct imprinting of knowledge on the

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000
brain which are second in need if we're going to keep up with the information

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000
explosion. We'll be able to replace probably

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000
every Bottomley all going to except the brain itself by

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
that time.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
Do you think there will be such a thing as you were

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000
telling this may be on the horizon immortality which seems

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000
to intrigue everybody for all their obvious reasons.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
Is

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
theoretically possible. And anything at sea are actually possible and usually turns

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
out to be practical but it would raise the most

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
appalling political and social problems I mean obviously people don't die. You can't

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000
allow anybody anybody to be born it's nothing like not just a question of a population control

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000
or control

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000
it's got to say stop that's it using you know on us

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000
with space exploration the two of them I go together might

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000
make it was certainly act as an incentive to space

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000
exploration but this is a space that expression isn't going to help the population problem is going to make it

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
worse like that first of all because the best and most active energetic people are going to

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.000
go off into space leaving the old fogies behind around the earth and that's going to make things worse here.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
Moreover you know emigration never really helps the population because in a few generations a new cut a

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
new kind of justice full of the old

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
ones. So it's kind of what the central cities are facing

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
today with the exodus and this is very

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
big but it is it is possible and the only hope of that we made

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000
such a mess of this planet already in the physical sense that our new chance is a start up for fresh and

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:51.000
profiting from our

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000
mistakes. The for far far sighted realestate dealer

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000
is going to start making claims and you've

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000
written some of your. To try to solve it so the more of a don't think they've got a benevolent valve be able to

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:04.000
claim

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000
that there are so many different attitudes expressed towards

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000
the new technology and the technology of the future some

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000
individuals feel completely threatened by this and others. Thrilled to

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000
the possibilities and I wonder what is your attitude. In general

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
are you optimistic about the future.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
Well I'm asked papers I wouldn't write so much about it I suppose if I stop

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000
completely depressed I'd play write it I'd write something like one hundred eighty four and then go and shoot myself as if

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000
I was an optimist and like our support of all that was the last thing he died on

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000
after he wrote nine hundred eighty four.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Now I am an optimist which is for several reasons. The main one is

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000
that I think you are an optimist you have a better chance of making the kind of future you

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
want come about you could might you may contrive what's called a self-fulfilling

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000
prophecy believe it in as Robert Frost. Yes.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000
What is left for you where do you considered space you're in

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000
the

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000
now actively involved in the exploration of see where do

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000
you want to go from here. Well no I

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000
think the space and the sea give me all I need to stew for the next.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000
The rest of my active life or so hopefully another twenty years or

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000
so. I hope I have done in fact very little underwater

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
exploration and I have a garage full of Aqua lines an air compressor and

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000
skin diving here back in Salaam but I'm afraid. While this movie's been in progress had very little chance of using it

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000
and I'm dying to get back down in the car reefs and the new notion again.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000
Well one thing to look forward to for even longer lifespan is to be able to read all your books and I want to

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
thank you very much for this interview. Thank

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000
