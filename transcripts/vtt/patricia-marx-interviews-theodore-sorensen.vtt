00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm delighted to have as my guest today Theodore Sorenson who is known to the world

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
as the trusted advisor and close friend of the late President Kennedy.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Mr Sorenson is author of a bestselling book about President Kennedy and is currently practicing

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
law in New York. He is also an editor at large of the Saturday

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Review and recently wrote an article for that magazine called The War in

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Vietnam how we can end it. This is our incident you broke a four year

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
silence about Vietnam with this article which was critical of our course in the war and

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
called for an indefinite hold in the bombing of North

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Vietnam and an increased effort to get

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
negotiations. Why did you decide to speak out

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
now I felt that the time had come for the supporters of

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
the administration to run

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
against continuing on our present course of escalation. I had not spoken our

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
previous lane because I am well aware after my years in the White

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
House of the burden the president already bears without my adding to them.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Of the information which he possesses that I do

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
not and of the need to give the president

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
some opportunity and discretion in foreign policy. Without dividing

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
the party in the country here at home but the present course has

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
had a fair chance to work and it's not

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
working and I think those of us who are concerned ought to speak out

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
now in a recent television interview Senator Robert Kennedy suggested that the

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
original aims of our involvement in Vietnam have been shifted by the Johnson administration in your

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
opinion is this true.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
We get into some very fine semantic problems they're not so certain that

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
it's quite

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
us black and white as both Senator Kennedy and those who

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
interpreted him have put it the fact is that

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
President Kennedy put his.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Helping the side off the enemies obtain their own

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
self-determination helping them secure their own country against

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
terrorism and the emphasis now is much more than it was

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
then while admitting some overlap on the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
United States taking a stand against world communism

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
in Vietnam. So that we do not have to take

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
it in how a or on our west coast

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
of bombing villages in Vietnam so that we will not

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
have cities bombed in America that raises as

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Senator Kennedy suggested very profound moral questions and

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
that is

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
symbolized by the fact that American forces have virtually taken over the

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
war which President Kennedy had hoped would not ever have to

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
happen in the winter of one nine hundred sixty five when it became evident that

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Southie Timmy's government could not withstand a communist takeover. If you had been an advisor

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
to the president would you have advised an American troop

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
commitment a real question is What are the options which faced

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
this country at that time were we limited to a

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
choice of a communist military conquest on the one

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
hand and United States forces taking over the war on the

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
other the whole.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Thrust of President Kennedy's policy was to prevent us from ever being faced with that choice.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Perhaps we were faced with the bin the winter of one nine hundred sixty five which case it

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
was a difficult choice between two very undesirable alternatives and President

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Johnson's selection of one of those is understandable but I don't know that we

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
were faced with that hard choice that there were no other alternatives but

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000
there was

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
no political or diplomatic action. Could have been

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
taken no insistence upon reforms on the part of the south of the enemies. Before

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000
we made a commitment to a point where they can now resist our suggestions for reform.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
So you suggesting that it might even involve able to become more

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
involved in internal domestic policies south you know put more

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
pressure on the kind of reforms that might make the government popular.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Yes we cannot run their government for them. We cannot impose democracy upon

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
another people. It's a little foolish to say that we are fighting for their

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
self-determination if we are denying them self-determination. But

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
a guerilla war can never be successfully

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000
countered by a government that is unpopular.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
That is despised and feared that

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
is unwilling to distribute

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
land to clean up corruption and to have.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Reasonable and fair policies of taxation

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and government administration and

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
social services. That's the problem that confronts us in Vietnam today the

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000
South Vietnamese

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
government is by no means accepted by the

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
people it is still largely confined to

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
the Mandarin the elite who control most of the land and most of

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
the wealth does not have support in the villages

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000
outside of the major

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000
cities and it is in those villages that the war is going to be won or lost.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
So the United States is pouring

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.000
in its men then materiel and money.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
In a cause that cannot succeed until the south of the

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
enemies do something about their own government and.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Some years ago before we made that kind. That investment of our men

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
and materiel was the time to have insisted upon those

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.000
conditions of course when we were beginning to increase our involvement.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
President Kennedy sent more it buys from six or seven hundred

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
to fifteen thousand advisors. It was at a time when probably the

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
worst dictator of all Yemen

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
was. Leading the country and was considerably less popular than even the government

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
of today.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Lie have a hard time. Patricia and comparing

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
dictators who is worse than another is hard

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
to say actually Z.M. when he first started up had a good deal

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
of

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
support and was entitled to it on the basis of what he was able to do

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
for the economy and for the education of the enemies and

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
for setting up a reasonably stable form of government.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
The trouble is that the longer he stayed in power the more he or pressed

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
his political opponents the more he became dependent upon

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
his brother and his sister in law Madam new the

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
more removed he apparently became

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
from reality and out of touch with his own

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
people and.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
President Kennedy you. Unfortunately was not aware of.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
These trends in actions and standing until

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
the it was too late and as you suggest we had increased

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
our commitment I don't pretend that

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
the Kennedy administration is free from blame

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
for where we are now in Vietnam. Mistakes were made them as

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
well to do as you suggest in your in your article that a

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
bombing sensation may lead to negotiations or at

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
least be a

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
necessary prerequisite before there is even any chance of that. I wonder what your reaction is

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
to a recent statement by Dean Acheson where he said there is no possibility of negotiating our

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:13.000
way out of Vietnam. The only way to end the war is to convince the communists their efforts have failed.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Do you think negotiations are feasible unless the communist feel that they really have no chance

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
of getting their own way and

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
so

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000
peace is going to come into the anomaly when both sides decide it is preferable to war.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Of course our efforts to prevent a communist military

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
conquest are aimed in that direction.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
I would think that we may have succeeded in doing that they should know by now that they are not going to take over

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
the South militarily.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
They see now a somewhat more legitimate government

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
and somewhat more viable economy in the south. The time may

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
well come then when they would prefer a negotiated

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
solution to continuing the

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
fighting the trouble is we don't know Dean Acheson doesn't know

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
I don't know the only way to find out is to stop the bombing and see if they will

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
negotiate because they've made it very clear as a matter of principle.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Whether you and I think it's a good principle or not is irrelevant. They have made it clear as a matter of principle

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000
that they will not negotiate while we are bombing their home and.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Many experts seem to feel that and noisey is going to hold out until after our domestic.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Elections and that nothing really and no matter what kind of

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
peace offers we make they will not be accepted what do you make of that assessment.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
I think that's very likely I don't think that we want to put ourselves in a position where the north of

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
the enemies are determining

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
our

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
political actions and as I mentioned if they

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
decide that peace

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
is better for. Them than war. Negotiations are better for them than

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
fighting and we will have peace and they will open negotiations.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
No matter who is president and no matter whether it is before or after the

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
elections but there is reason to believe

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
that they are hopeful. Perhaps deceiving

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
themselves that the elections will bring about such a change in

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
the American government that they will be able

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
to obtain a better bargain for negotiating

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
table and there is some feeling also that

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
they are suspicious of President Johnson and unwilling to trust him

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000
at the negotiating

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
table. But as I say that that

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
is not a matter that should influence Americans in the presidential campaign we must choose

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
our presidents on the basis of who is going to be the best man

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000
for our point of view not from the communist point of view.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Do you think it is possible for President Johnson to change his course now that

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
he's committed so much of his prestige and so much of American resources and

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
lives to winning the war in Vietnam.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:13.000
You

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
would not have to be a dramatic change President Johnson has said himself on more than one

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.000
occasion that a negotiated solution is the only sensible solution in Vietnam.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
He has said as Dean Rusk has only

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
recently that we are looking and listening for ways to engage

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
the other side in the goshi ations. I think if we look and listen the little

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
harder and stop the bombing which the president has also done before we

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
might I emphasize the word might find the negotiations

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000
could be

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
started now you mention in your article that we have never put forth

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
a mutually acceptable plan for negotiations that

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
we've had a great deal of rhetoric but very little can. In Crete. He's a

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000
big step to build plans.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Do you doubt the will and resolve of the administration to negotiate.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
I don't want to get into personal criticism of the

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:13.000
administration.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
I think that the administration rather naturally is looking

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
for an English eating position that will not be vulnerable to

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
political attack and

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
congressional criticism there is no such thing go shooting position. There is no

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
solution no settlement in Vietnam that is not going to be

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
risky dangerous with many

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
disadvantages with many

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
deficiencies and subject to the bitterest kinds of attacks from the hawks and the

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
militants and the military and the Republicans and the Southern Democrats and others

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
on Capitol Hill and the president and the rest of his administration might as

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
well realize that right

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
now I would do what you feel the reaction at home would be if

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
we withdrew from the unknown and did not win the objection. The objectives of

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
the state.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Depends what you mean by withdraw them depends what you mean by objectives I think that the

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
American people are not in favor of surrender and they're not in favor of a

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
humiliating withdrawal which we go back on our commitments

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
to those Southie enemies

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
and we asked to stand up for their own independence. On the

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
other hand I do not think that they would be that kind

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
of negative reaction to a negotiated settlement.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Which assured the existence of a Sufi

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
in which you prevented a military

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
conquest of South Vietnam. Which protected those of

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
the enemies who did stand up her own government from a slaughter by

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
the North Vietnamese that in my opinion would be securing our essential

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
objectives. I think the consequences internationally would

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
be if it proved that we could not win this kind of

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
guerrilla war if we were brought to the negotiating table and a coalition government

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
came about and it became clear that we

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
couldn't actually defeat the kind of war that we were trying to put

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
down and I think it's already clear that we cannot actually defeat that kind of war no one has

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
ever defeated that kind of war guerrilla wars don't end in that

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
fashion and because there is a change in the in

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000
the atmosphere

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
the water becomes too cold for the fish

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:38.000
to swim

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
in under

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
the order saying a mouse a tongue so

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
that the world already has a pretty good

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
idea of the limitations of American bombers

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
and American heavy arms in trying to

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
prevent. Grillers from coming down a jungle trail not very

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
effective Mr Thornton What is your

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
reaction to the point of view that this threat of

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000
international communism has become much less great in the last few years with.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
The rift between China and Russia and that it's no longer

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
the obligation of the United States to

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
to intervene and get involved in guerrilla wars and wars

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
of national liberation.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
The term international communist movement has considerably less meaning than it

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
had before and consequently I think less of a threat to the Soviets are

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
no

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
longer threatening in the same

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
open military fashion that we once feared the

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Chinese are talking that way but they have been much

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000
more cautious in

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
their actual attempts

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
to cross borders with.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Troops so that we cannot ignore

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
the conflict of interest between ourselves and the

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Soviets and Chinese and their various

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
allies we cannot ignore the differences in human

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
values ideologies.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
We cannot ignore the attempt they will make to expand their

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
sphere of influence at our expense and ultimately

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
to our political

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
diplomatic and economic

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000
disadvantage United States does not want to be alone in the world that would be

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
bad United States and would be bad for the world so that any system

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
which threatens

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
to erode the survival of other

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
democracies and friends the world around is one which

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000
we cannot simply smile and say it's none of our business.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:02.000
But I

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000
I do not think that we face the same kind of united aggressive

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
threat that we faced ten or more years ago.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Returning to the home scene. What do you think is the effect of the

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
protesters on policy do they make any difference might they

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
have an effect in changing our policy in Vietnam.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
I think that the obvious.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Presence frequency sometimes prevalence of the scent

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
on Vietnam cannot fail to have an effect on

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000
the Congress which in turn has its effect on the president presidents

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
are properly given a wide latitude in the exercise of foreign

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
policy but no president has ever been able to ignore public opinion

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Tarlac. The war in Vietnam in the long run is going to

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
be ended. Not because of

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
our superior. Military

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000
power but because of our superior brain power because we come up with some ideas because we come up with

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000
some alternatives because we come up with some solutions and therefore I think it is a good

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
thing for our university campuses and others to

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
be offering constructive criticism

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
and suggestions. But if

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000
by protesters You mean those

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
who try to block action

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
in the Pentagon stop the selective service centers from

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
operating those who

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:39.000
make

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
a practice of violence in the name of

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000
nonviolence those who act in the

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
strangest illegal ways calling for a moment of

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
silence for Che Guevara.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Or burning themselves in before the United Nations or.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:07.000
What have you that does not influence our foreign policy in the slightest.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
It only persuades the president that he is right because he is opposed by a lot of kooks.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
You know only discourages the Congress

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
from participating in this kind of criticism because they

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000
do not want to be associated with that kind of extremism and the

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:31.000
average American who watches these demonstrators on his television set at home.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Besides that he had better abandon those dovish thoughts that he had and it's hard

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000
because. Dogs are not reasonable

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.000
and creative constructive people other hand.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Coaching

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
men who view the news in somewhat the start of

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
perspective reads that fifty thousand Americans are surrounded

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
the Pentagon and he thinks our society is on the verge of collapse and it would be food. Was for him

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000
to engage in negotiation.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
So they are simply hurting their own cause when they resort to

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
extreme tactics I'm convinced that the extremists are not

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
the dominant

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
figures in the protest movement but because they say they are the

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000
most

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000
wild and exaggerated. Statements

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000
and present a rather colorful picture with their beards and

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000
their feed the press and television naturally give most of

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000
their attention to these extremists and it gives the whole peace movement a bad name.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Eugene McCarthy is running for the Democratic nomination nine hundred sixty eight.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
As a candidate that wants negotiations and as

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
you say to the bombing. Since this

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000
represents something close to your own opinion. Do you support soon because I

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:01.000
think now we know.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:07.000
I think that until. President Johnson announces whether he is a candidate.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
Until center McCarthy demonstrates whether or not he is a serious candidate that

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000
any kind of statement of commitment would be premature.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000
I admire Senator McCarthy stand on Vietnam.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000
I admire

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
his intellectual capacity and his legislative record

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
on a great many issues but he is not a serious candidate in

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000
my opinion and I'm a realist in politics.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:43.000
I think that if the president desires to be renominated he will be renominated.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
I think he will be opposing. A Republican such as Nixon

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000
or Reagan who will take a much less desirable position

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
on Vietnam.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
That it will be important to defeat that Republican candidate and I don't intend to do.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Say anything now which will make it more difficult for us to defeat that

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Republican candidate next fall.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:13.000
Do you foresee a time in the in the near future if there is an escalation of the war and there's increased.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Dissension in this country where Robert Kennedy will feel obligated to try to get the

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000
nomination in one thousand nine hundred eighty eight.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000
It's not a matter of whether he feels obligated or not Robert Kennedy is also a

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000
political realist and he is well aware of the fact that even if he entered

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000
and won every single presidential primary there would not be the slightest possibility of his

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.000
being nominated president over Lyndon Johnson who is the incumbent.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
Do you foresee a time when Senator Kennedy will be president in seventy

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000
two Well Patricia one nine hundred seventy two

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000
is five years away.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
And so much can happen in five years in

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
politics that it's not really worth speculating

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
about five years ago I was in the White

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000
House life was very different. So the sound of Kennedy knows

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000
that he doesn't know whether they'll be a Republican president then he doesn't know

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000
whether Johnson will been reelected and whether Johnson will been reelected

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000
and perhaps died so that there will be another Democrat incumbent president who's eligible for reelection

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
and no one has the slightest idea

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000
when Senator Kennedy will have a clear shot at the nomination so for him to

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
be making any plans on it would be

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
foolish to indulge in in speculation for a moment

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000
longer there have been many people that

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000
are predicting an increase in violence in this country. Daniel Moynihan

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000
even said that he first saw it at the time of an outbreak of terrorism. What is your

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:58.000
assessment of the of the state of the nation and the way things are evolving in this country.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
I don't believe that we are on. Verge of guerrilla

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
warfare but I am very concerned

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000
about the STATE OF THE NATION. I think that a

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000
malaise as such all over the American people

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000
traceable in large respect

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000
to their inability to see the war in Vietnam

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000
and

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:29.000
the conflict in the cities in the proper perspective.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000
Some people are violent. Some people are simply irritated.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Some people are taking out their frustrations on

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.000
government and on foreigners and on taxes and on trade.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000
Some people are protesting and marching others are simply indifferent

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
to the print world problems. I don't

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000
like to see that President Kennedy had a marvelous

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
neck for putting these problems in perspective. He didn't

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000
expect everyone to agree with him he had many enemies but at least

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000
the country was thinking it was alive or was debating constructive

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000
courses that we should

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
follow and I regret

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
the the fall from that high

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
standard given as recalcitrant Congress and

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000
a reelection of of the consumers of coalition. Do you

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000
feel that more programs could get through Congress is it likely that the kind

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
of measures that are necessary to forestall the increase in riots

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000
and dissent among the negroes. Could it get through the Congress as it's

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:49.000
constituted I doubt it certainly not without a lot more.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Leadership a lot more education a lot larger effort

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
to stir the American people to realize how they must meet their

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.000
responsibilities. To face up to the problems in our cities

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000
the treatment of minorities and the need for

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
legislation and large expenditures

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000
to alleviate those problems and alleviate the now.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000
Many critics in the New Left feel that it's just impossible given the system that we

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.000
have and the power structure that we have that the country will respond in time.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000
What is your feeling about this.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000
My feeling is the same as Winston Churchill's statement of some time ago that it

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000
is the worst system except for every other that's ever been

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000
tried and I would not willingly

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:49.000
ended for any kind of dictatorship from the new left or from anyone else.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
Mr Sorensen thank you for this interview. My guest has been Theodore

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000
Sorenson formerly special counsel to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson and

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:04.000
currently a lawyer in private practice and an editor at large of the Saturday Review.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Thank you and good bye for now.
