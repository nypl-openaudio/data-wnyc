00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
There's been a great deal of enthusiasm about the rebirth of comedy and satire in America.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
One of the first to prove that there is an audience for literate and devastating humor is my guest today.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Sometimes called the king of the sacred cow punches. Mr Mort Sahl.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This is so for three years before you got your first break I understand you were earning an average of

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
about forty six dollars from your a year from your performances in writing what kept you going.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I was waiting for this rebirth I still keep me going what rebirth.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Well you began it and then there was a whole group of

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
comedians such as name a mike

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
like I remember them with you if you have time which one of them has

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
to do with any rebirth. Mike Nichols is a director and Elaine May as a writer

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I try to see them perform their work anywhere. Let me do for a

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
while where when they had a show write a New York Review and they did something

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
about high school people necking and something about

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Freud I'd hardly call it social reform. I don't agree with you but the comedians of

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
all I think as a matter of fact they're delinquent as citizens. The

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
only time they're interested in politics is when their star struck with the president and they're invited to the White House which is

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
a containment policy

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
anyway. What do you mean the comedian has to be socially concerned in the so she

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
was former He not only has to be a social reformer I mean if he wants to be but he has to

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
be critical of his colleagues like a good psychiatrist. Well fire. Well I just.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I think they're delinquent citizens. I think they look the other way I think they're a moral.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Was someone like Lenny Bruce is criticized for looking so hard in

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
deciding critics criticizing it so violently does anyway I

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
mean tolerate He has the morality of a fifteen year old. I mean squares don't know what he's talking about and

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
hit people that occurred to them when they were twelve. There's nothing profound about what he

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
does but you cannot waste your time you only got so much time as an adult and you have to listen to

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
a

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
lumination there's nothing happening with that in other words. I kind of entertainment I just don't think

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
it's in lightning and it's not social reform I think people confuse KRON ology

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
a lot of people came along about the same time. But let's give the audience about not the performers the

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
audience showed that there was an appetite that demonstrated that the performers didn't meet the appetite.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
You were implying that you are the only one is meeting the appetite.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Well I do what I do. I've been defending that for the last ten years but the thing

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
that I do is concerned with you know that's concerned by itself

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
but one of those one I'm shot down in flames I go down on the plane alone I don't see a lot

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
of company when I'm doing well I hear about this group this new wave there is NO

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
NO WAY.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
What about the Second City fridges that's political satire.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
No it is and when when did you ever see in the political side that. Oh I've never

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.000
seen

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
any they do they do ones on the on the candidates and on their Also social satire

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and psychology on. Phony lovers and

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
well all but all of that is safe. It's only daring

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
if you know it's not very daring to come into New York and do jokes about a segregationist it's

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
all safe. I don't none of that shakes me up. I find that very and you know I'm speaking not as

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
a comedian but as a member of the

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
audience. Do you mean that you would demand that they go after the political and social ills of the time

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
in this with what are you only make demands on myself I don't make any demands on anyone else we're doing it right now

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
mean no one's no no no I although that's definitely something in the man's whistle is not the same

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
as payment on demand. You can't make a demand for someone who has no funds. Let me put it that way.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
You know making demands but in order for you to approve what would you like to

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.000
see

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
the comedian be doing all of the should do whatever they like that they are that's up to them whether it's Jerry Lewis

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
or Jonathan Winters whoever let him do what they want to do but they should not pass themselves as

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Embraer pass themselves off as improvisational or satirical satire is a pretty good word you know when you say that

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
I'm thinking about people like Mark

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Twain is nobody of that caliber today. I don't see the.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
I know because I have nights off and I go out to see people. I don't call it satirical to talk

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
about sex in the suburbs. That's not satire that's nonsense it's playing footsie under

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000
the table. What is

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
said satire

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
is a literarily based X.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
ray of the society. It's an onslaught. It's an attack and believe me

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
this country needs an attack this country needs a critic. So the best thing you could have is a critic on

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
staff that would mean we're alive and we're vital.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
This is how you see things need to be attacked society needs to be attacked to

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
fix most of all what aspects. You know. Well many aspects need to be attacked and in

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
other words the whole value system needs to be scrutinized whether or not people are acquisitive has to

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
be scrutinized not just politics.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
People have to other words political interpretations or if a sociological interpretation. Whether

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
or not the roles are changing between men and women in America. Why monogamy

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
is crumbling in the western world not only in America we have to find

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
out why you wish to find out about violence.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
We have to find out a lot of things we have to listen with a thirty year. Dr Reichs and if we can

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.000
develop

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
one. Does the you rest or do you try to eliminate or

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
to reform I mean what is the what's the importance of

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
it. What's the importance of what I have to ask the critics are right

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
about the importance is that I can do it that's the mirror.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
What do you hope to achieve is put it that way whether you do it or not.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Well I'm accepted on my own terms. A lot of people in the audience who think what I think but

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
because of the social structure and certain restrictions imposed by themselves upon

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
themselves they are accountants and

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
executives and taxi drivers and everything else and I happen to have

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
because a psychological reaction

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
probably have found this out but I can articulate so I speak for them the day I

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
stop speaking for them and only for myself I probably will. Be

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
working well you said you've got to examine when asked to examine such things as

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000
the changing role women should stand for size and the values.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Granted you have to examine what have you come up with what system if you come up with

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
yourself what the system was what our values. What system of values I come up

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
with well I say I mean it's apparent that certain values. You know

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
I tripped over because they were there. There was old as the rocks I didn't discover them.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
I rediscovered them because they have meant obfuscated under a Cross station

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
of debris in our society today there are only

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
certain things you cling

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
to whether you recognise a virtue. Whether you recognize decency.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Whether you are loyal certain values that's all what you're capable of not

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
running away. Whether you're more in your own way than other people are in your

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
way and and whether or not you can deal with other people and their

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
words what is emerging as a human being your own man being honest yourself what do you mean

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
by being your own man's most important thing for anybody being your own person that's tough. I mean that

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
when you meet someone who is sane and level and has

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000
balance of

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
values. I don't think that normal means average. It's

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
an achievement to be a normal human being and should not be passed off civilised

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
people should be prized that's what I

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
mean and you would normally you would be in my normal. I don't

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000
know

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
I mean that's a pretty That would be a subjective. Are

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
you your own men very much so very much my own

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
man wasn't making

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
normal in the way you describe it the values are not particularly secure. I mean

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000
they're very obvious ones that

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
you know people obscure them and then the they are not obscure to begin with look

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
at traditional They only become radical when people try to obfuscate them for

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
instance. I'm my own man but that's. All of it that's only act

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
one act two is doesn't all fit into place what does it cost to

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
be your own man. If you get on the stage twice a night for forty five

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
minutes and you have to pay for it by being in pain the rest of the

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
day in a conflict with people. That's an excess of cost and possibly

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
an unnecessary. You know not

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
necessary to have to examine not just to find out so being your own man is only

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
act one is act two and I three.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Do you find that there's much resistance to the point of view that you

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
have and

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
express and sometimes there is but it depends if you're ahead of yourself in

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
other words if I have a view of the world and other people don't have the

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000
view they will reject

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.000
it. I mean I would think everyone would ascribe to the view human decency and honesty.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Well you know if you put it down like that if I was a Boy Scout. I mean that if you make

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
a remark about

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
a public figure. And you get resistance from the audience. That doesn't mean they

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
don't agree with you it has come to mean that they

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
do. And it's like people know that someone

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
they resent it when they know somebody isn't making it and you remind them and

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
one of their reactions is to pull away only a naive performer would say. Well I've said

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:19.000
something they don't agree

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
with it's not that it's that they do agree with it they know another or just some people they

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
don't know at all and there's some people they know all too well and that's the

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000
difference since it did after the Eisenhower administration.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:34.000
And frame of

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
mind was over that you know some of the inspiration in Morden see

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
for your for your jokes you think this is too little who said it. Oh

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
it's Redan and your comment

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
but

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
was you're qualified as gospel. No I'm

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
just a matter of fact the two best records I made in my

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
opinion were made during the Kennedy. Strange

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
but they're all fair game. There's no utopians there's no

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
imminent danger of utopia in the government and the only

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
people that say that are usually Democrats who don't want to hear a Democrat attacked. So

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000
then they tell you that jokes

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.000
about Eisenhower funny. That's because they have no mercy toward.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Vice President

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Nixon and they're scared to death that the lose. They have

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
fallen idols in a Democratic Party. I'm not scared to death. That's

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
my secret.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
I just did your opinions about some of the candidates for office. How do you like

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Goldwater Goldwater's too easy all the comedians are going to make jokes about

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Goldwater Goldwater is a temptation because he looks like an

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
extreme socially irresponsible performers are going to make jokes about

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
him but the more subtle areas and the greater threats are the people

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
who are going to run and if you're responsible adult you should get into you

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
know one I should say one should get

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
into that area. We don't have to start with an extreme Republican

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
we should start with the Democratic Party. Well let's start with Johnson and the Democrats were the

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
ones you know who ridiculed him when he was the vice president about his not being

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
around all of these great satirists on a program called that was the week that was

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Rose telling him. JOHNSON You know the vanishing American where you see the vice president has vanished.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Now they're telling me he's wonderful why can't we just that rapidly. I don't fall in love at first

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
sight with anybody.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Johnson was elected to Congress in one nine hundred thirty six I believe he's been in politics all his life and

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000
suddenly found himself in

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
government and there's a wide gulf involved

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
there and he received the next we heard he had received the stereo said from Bobby

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Baker and then. He would have been better off accepting components because he

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
could put them in the closet along with Bobby Baker in the entire affair.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Now and now we. He we hear that you know he is the only candidate that

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
the Democratic Party has

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
so. I would that seems odd you know I thought the Democratic Party was.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
You know abundant and wonderful people of Middle East to hear the Democrats say it but they CAN

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
I wonder how far the Democrats can

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
rationalize before they say anything they went from Roosevelt to

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Truman to Stevenson to Kennedy to Johnson.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
They're just going to keep going. I think you could

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
bring you can I once said that I believe

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
cruise ship could be nominated on the Democratic ticket by there saying he's better

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
than Nixon. That's the whole Democrats all facade. They have no program except

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Who else is there which is hardly a program. I'd never get married on that

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.000
basis. So there's Johnson I guess I get a feel Romney hasn't told us yet we don't know yet.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
So once he ends the suspense. But politics you know politics a part of the Act Some nights

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000
I don't do it at

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
all Lou else you said not the extremists. You should begin with like the

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
water what about Rockefeller how do you feel about him would govern

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Iraq a vote

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Yeah well he's probably a right wing social democrat. I mean I have

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
a system of categories you know I should explain to

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:22.000
you that house we have eighty one categories it makes it simple. It simplifies it for me.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Governor Rockefeller is as a matter of fact is closer to the Kennedy line of thinking than the president

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
is that's one of the ironies of our time have a Republican leader who is left of the

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Democratic president.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
It's only ironic if you believe in the system in the system. What system. Anyway it's anarchic

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:38.000
in

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
effect Governor Rockefeller is. The governor of a feller

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
who lives in this apartment house and Nixon as I understood it that was generically that's what started that

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
in the same apartment house and his ex-wife rocky and his friends live in this apartment

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
house then there's. He then went to New Hampshire where the

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
people I the press interprets. Defeat up there is the fact that people didn't like the fact that he got

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
married that's considered immoral getting married in the circles I grew up in that's considered very

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
moral there are more immoral acts than not and then getting married

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
but Rocky and happy everybody has a nickname

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Ladybird happy. Jackie we have a lot of that they don't go much for

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
grace in this era and I don't mean capital G.. But first

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
ladies you know going by grace by the way I want to make a point here.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
There's a broker's attitude in America that's very

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
unhealthy it goes like it's a broker's attitude about winning people say that

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
guy hasn't got a chance but they never evaluate that guy unquote That's

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
in italics that. Term that

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
guy they go by ratings I watched Soandso show it had the highest rating on

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
television but they don't they never lament the fact that something worthwhile had a

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000
low rating. They just kind of want to get with the winners I never have understood that. But

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
it's more prevalent now than it is ever been in the last in the last ten years and I've

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
noticed it's become more prevalent. We have widespread throughout the country

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
people's brokers' attitude. Rockefeller doesn't have a chance that the first ones if he were elected would be standing in line to

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
say shake hands with the president.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
These people were ridiculing Johnson as a man who wasn't vice president Robert Kennedy was a

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
vice president in fact now they turn around and they're saying we're certainly lucky to have him at the helm.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
If you could use anybody in the whole in the

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000
whole country not even when necessarily that's running whom might you think you have any ideas on that.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Well yeah I have a lot of ideas and I just don't have been tasered so would be to display

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
them now I can't believe that in a country of two hundred million

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
people in the United States America's richest country in world. I can believe all the talent available

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
to us from William O. Douglas to Dr Oppenheimer to all the people in

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
the lab but Cal Tech that the greatest person. We

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
have is Senator Johnson. Besides if he's president is going to run that majority since

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
he ran it so well everyone discovered they didn't say that when he was running it.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
It's wonderful how retrospect hindsight is beautiful Monday morning quarterbacks

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000
and kashrus Clay is the champion great leadership when you're going to run for office. I'm not interested in

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
politics you know I'm going to do a play in the fall.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
What did you just take what did you decide in Sydney. Bruce Bruce things when we know what is

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
about what's on the left of this generation and it's about a guy who is his own man and

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
it's something that I you know it's a different way to say something I don't want to be an

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
actor and I wouldn't be looking for a play if I wasn't doing this which is very

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
special with your role in it I my role is it's me if I had gone to

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
write instead of run.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000
It's Lorraine Hansberry's first place since Raisin in the sun so the reader merino and it's it's going to be a

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
very exciting play as it's a real bite because it says something talks about the nobility of man it

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000
has to do with something.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
It's not another homosexual song in the

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
theatre and you see many shows and you've been

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
you're watching a working seven days so you know you know I try to see

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000
something when I mean the last time I was here I went to the theatre a couple of times

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
and listen to your shows I have to wait till I come to Los Angeles to see them but the New

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
York theater is highly overrated the snobbery is not

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
justified and it's usually indulged in by people who have gone and promoted going

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000
to Hollywood and then find the fashionable to wrap Hollywood after accepting its

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000
gifts and coming back

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
here when it's not so overrated now because all they talk about is how sick the theater is

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
now about it is it is a very bad business is not overrated they're diagnosing

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
the malice there.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Look at the the Actors Studio they get enough publicity here to make that I mean they

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
do buy a dynamite and I play one performance I mean

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
what right do they have to look down on other people based on what. Their job is to communicate

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000
with the audience I know the audience gets in their hair and bothers them but they're. That is that's the

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
theater when you get up and talk and there's an audience that's the answer and that's all of it would be for

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
your interest. What aspects or what would you like about

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000
it anyway your communicate ideas the people and it doesn't mean they have to accept them just so that

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000
they're shook up they you leave them with something residual when they leave I don't care if they disagree they can write

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000
letters but the big thing is that either reinforce their own prejudice or they change their mind so

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
they change yours or whatever but it's an interchange of ideas that's what it's

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
for and until we have coffee houses again we'll have to settle. But they are bringing change

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000
or ideas.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
What do you seen recently that you think

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
better ideas young man man from you please.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Probably but if you

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000
like Who's Afraid of Virginia moved to D.C. I don't like it because that is a

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
pretty critical view of the

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000
changing roles of men and women by someone who hasn't practiced marriage as you know as well he's

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
a critic of it but you don't have to practice everything you criticize your critique

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
of politics you know the politician.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000
Well yeah but that's I don't think that that analogy holds up that's the

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000
obvious analogy but I don't think that holds up. I didn't stand up and

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000
say it's anarchy. All politicians are corrupt there is no hope there's no note of hope in

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
that place that there is no way out I don't accept

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
that you are you an optimist you think there is you

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000
know you got out of bed this morning I must if I were

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
an e-list I wouldn't take the trouble to say I'm one on the my on the on the show.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Do you think that things are getting better.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Yes slowly. Not quickly enough that's the only complaint I have and

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000
the feeling impatience I display of course they are getting better there are several signs that they're getting better

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
but boy is that an uphill fight. You know we're swimming through blue a tough time a lot

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
of impediments going.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:59.000
It's tough. We're paying an excessive cost for what we accomplish because we're buying time.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000
What kind of things. Indicated improvement in

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
conditions. Well when a guy

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
like Marlon Brando was the highest paid actor in Hollywood and he's also the

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
best director. It's good you know he's not off Broadway somewhere obscure

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
and people can go down there and say well I like him but he's not commercial that's good

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000
and when I can say what I say and have a large audience that's

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000
encouraging these are in the areas

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
of theater

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
when if you think money ran to become

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000
successful doesn't become less good. Since the early days.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
That's a typical middle class right wing

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000
social democratic reaction as any three if you're eighty when you think you know you know a lot of other words on a list that's the

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
same old thing though of course he got better the more he was encouraged to have more confidence he worked

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
more and he was unsteady your feet so the speak in other words you

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
equate success with corruption and that's not a problem with just the military in this case

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000
so I wasn't convinced he

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
was getting better since he was getting more

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
popular done right is getting better is the best we

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
have one nothing a minute be this we had been I don't think Mutiny on the bounty

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
or the American is going to say the wild one or

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
so I'll go into line for line with Marlon Brando

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000
One Eyed Jacks is the best directorial job I've ever seen in a motion picture bar

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000
none including David

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Lean for whom I have the upmost respect I worship his work. I believe

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000
that the performance in the body is a

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000
virtuoso performance. He's one of the greatest comedians we have on

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
screen great sense of comedy most actors are cumbersome in comedy.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000
He's brilliant. There are twenty seven separate scripts on bounty and he should not have to pick up the tab for

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
that that's not his fault that confusion.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000
He's always convincing and remember his virtue is that he brings something to a role he brings something to it so

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
the Steve McQueen.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000
The people who come in and are themselves are not acting. He brings something to a role and

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000
he takes a chance and I tried the ugly American and perhaps you feel we missed but he tried

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
the courage to look to inspect and to try

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:14.000
to lift things to be uplifting is a moral person.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
What are the sons of Marlon Brando and and

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
you. Well you know didn't limit

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000
the world that I know that size and your view of this.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Which is unfair when you're doing a review of this tape as you

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000
conducted me and I just there's going to be a moderator are you going to choose up sides. If

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000
you want to debate with me. That'll be different then you'll probably lose because

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000
I know this

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
area but you know I'm not you know I'm not I don't know my

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000
boxing gloves on here. There are several signs in other words we signed

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
a limited test ban with the Russians. We know

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
that we also know that their adventure early

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000
so minority groups are going to come into their own in this country. Whatever the

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:01.000
motivation

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
on the civil rights bill is it's being I think the bill is a

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000
joke and the bill is a joke it's an exercise in motion a cathartic

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000
step for some people it's profit for separationist be they white

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000
or dark and it's candy coated it has

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000
no teeth in it it's just a term but it's a start. Or

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:24.000
I could say

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
the president's getting civil rights off to a whopping stop.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000
What do you think about the mystique you know the idea that women

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000
should express themselves in careers.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Well there's a lot that's that's valid in Betty Friedan's book but there's a lot that

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
isn't and it's one of you know it's the remarks are made in a very strident

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000
tone although I agree with many of them. It's just that her sumption in

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000
some areas or the women who read it assume probably

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
that they have something to say see I think women are frauds in the sense

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000
that they're too competitive. In America. And they don't have anything to offer.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000
It's bad enough to be competitive when you marry a guy but when you really don't want to compete then you're a hypocrite.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:09.000
You're a

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000
liar women allies say oh I want to do this and I wanted to they don't want to do that

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
they are female impersonators they don't want to be girls but they don't want to be men

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000
either because that's tough yet to perform when you're a man and it is not in the nature of

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000
women to perform. It's very tough on

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000
them and it was all women are really worried about is being abandoned men are the

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000
ones who have to perform and they do have to

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000
perform whether it is in business or in the

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000
service to be

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:46.000
brave or they have to be noble in their public life or whether they have to perform.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000
You know in the act of love or whatever to be graphic. Men have to perform.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000
Women have to kind of organize life. But they don't want to do that so they say well you know

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
I don't know a chance to express myself and I become the protest group. I don't I don't believe See

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
I don't think they really want to

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
I don't think that they really want to compete ask you know you don't have to ask me ask

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000
somebody who's well equipped

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000
ask the psychology department at Columbia. Ask any of the people up there wouldn't people

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000
graduate school the dependency rate with women. So if they don't have figures to accommodate their view that

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
women are not dependable they marry them they're back in school and they're out of school ask them up

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000
there and their fellows who are not biased many of them are

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
therapists. This is selling in your act to use a lot of psychological terminology. Do you

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000
take psychology very seriously if you study did.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000
I don't know anything I don't know I've studied I well I mean I have to in school but not

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000
twenty great degree. I I do that as a kind of a put on that's the kid

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000
the generation that's a sideways poke in the ribs at the elbow in the ribs It sounds

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000
like a restaurant advertising men would drink in New

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000
York advertisement will drink most anywhere New York that's the wonderful thing about them they have a universality.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.000
No I use terms. Put on to reflect the generation that uses the terms

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000
doesn't know what they mean. Most people think that's valid I don't know what I'm talking about that's you

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000
know it's just like people use a musician's language are very rarely. Hip.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000
They're usually happen. You play a lot of big clubs now like Copacabana you New York.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Do you find the audiences there appreciate your stuff as much as when you were in smaller

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000
smaller places.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
It's a commercial venture the owners were not back in the air force of didn't get to the audiences

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000
but if I'm really rooting for my side the gotta get through to people you

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
can't discriminate against them and put them into a small room and say that's the only

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000
way the Blue Angels nothing but expense accounts and guys with white socks

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000
but people think that that's very intellectualized and hip on the side and it's

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:53.000
not Wherever there are people and a microphone you can work.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000
You know it's tough to be the first one

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000
in but you've got to do it if you believe in what you're doing. If you just choose

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000
your shots you're not a champion. Thank you very much.
