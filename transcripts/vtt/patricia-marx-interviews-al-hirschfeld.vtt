00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Patricia Marx. Interview each week at this time your city station brings you an interview with a

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
leading figure in the arts politics or the sciences and here now to introduce

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
today's program is Patricia marks.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I have with me today Mr Al Hirschfeld who is the outstanding

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
character tourist of the theatrical world.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Mr Hirschfeld drawings have been gracing the front page of The New York Times' Drama section for over

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
twenty five years his works have been printed throughout the world and they hang in

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
our leading using humans. Among his best love books our show

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
business is no business and Herzfeld on American

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
theater. Mr So when did you do your first caricature.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
How did this come

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
about well action employee like most things.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I went to the theater in the early twenty's and I did a drawing on the back

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.000
of

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
a program. Kind of a

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
doodle of I think it was good tree Sasha good

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
tree and the press agent of the show asked me to do this on a

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
clean piece of paper and he would take it to around to a paper.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I did that and following Sunday it was printed and in the Tribune

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
on rather large and then I started doing a weekly drawing for them

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and then one day I received

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
a telegram from solid tower the times I thought it was a friend

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
of mine pulling my leg and called up The Times and asked for Xyloto

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and sure enough there was such a

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
man and he asked me to do a drawing of Harry

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Lauder and I did that and I looked at the dash downstairs

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and this procedure went on for some years about three years I never met anybody at the time

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and I always received a

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
telegram. Assigning me to do a specific

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
drawing and Monday and that's there in the lobby. I

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
was met Sam Zell it down he said You are the most mysterious man on the paper.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And I said why no man ever get by the dome and and so I

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
don't like some I come down to come up and cheat on the show I dead in there and that I can show it to him

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
friends from then

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
on will I understand that at the time when when you first did

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
this first drawing that you were painting and you had been a sculptor before. That's right it was just was

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
the work you did before this related to portrait one on writing

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
is you know I mean sculpture is a kind of US A drawing a fall over in the dark really you know.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
It's all drawing the one form or another it's just you were

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
doing people. Yes and I've always been interested in

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
graphic things. And due to the limitation of

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
the actual printing in a paper which is predator very.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
As I saw just a bit better than toilet paper really you know and as you have

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
to learn to use

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
the limitations of that paper. You can't get to and so it's research it's

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
all restricted except the printing itself is so

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
primitive that that limits you into a simple

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
almost calligraphic. Medium.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Would you say that you would do this differently if you had Laura.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Oh yes. Yes Well I would use

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
three dimensional things I would do more things in depth with the

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
grades and different techniques. I've tried this on various occasions but

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I'm always disappointed in the result in the

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
printing it never has any quality of

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
no sprightliness and it just is dead like a photograph.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Mr says. You seem to stand alone in this field particularly in terms

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
of the theatre is capturing a dying art then.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
In this country it's has never been a very fashionable or popular.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
I wouldn't say. It's been fashionable and not popular such put it that

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.000
way publications like Vanity Fair.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
That died during the depression has never

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
been replaced the New Yorker hasn't replaced it with the

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000
New York originally

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
had some good caricaturist Birnbaum and free.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
But in recent years it's become stilted I

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
think graphically except there comics I think I've done had a tremendous and

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
very good influence on the graphic art throughout the world.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
But in the field of caricature very little as there's hardly any outlet left in this

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
country you think it really is a matter of fact it is not popular there's not much demand

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000
why I don't know the demand out that's a chicken and egg thing you know.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
The editors are at fault here. They seem to

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.000
think

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
that and quite rightly in some cases I think that

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
caricature as pokes fun at

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000
people. Well it

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000
doesn't well it does. I suppose almost any interpretation.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000
If that person is humorous it comes out humorous you know if it's.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Dramatic it's comes out

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
dramatic the character doesn't invent that person he

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
merely translates in graphic terms what exist. And it's not a question

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
of distorting physical defects are

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
advantages that people

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
have it's a question of interpretating them I mean it isn't essential to make up for someone who

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
has a big nose to make it bigger that becomes a grotesque gray and very the

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Germans one and a lot for that and the English too in some strange way.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000
My sense of it is I don't know whether the word caricature is even a right terminology as.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
I like to think of them as character drawings with I hope some.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Weapon involved but I never.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Have subscribed to the idea that it's necessary

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
to trade on these physical attributes that people have you know

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.000
The yourself that you. Recognize your friends not because of any.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Peculiar physical thing I mean you see a man a block away. You don't know whether he has large years or

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
small years but you know what

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Joe. Something about him not he is

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
one unique one out of the whole millions of people and have it the

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
world and you recognize them. You'd be hard put to it to want

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
to translate into words what about this man why

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
you recognized him.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
It has nothing to do with his clothes you could be wearing a brand new

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
suit and he doesn't have to have a distinguished gator of peculiar walk but there's

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
something about him. That's Joe

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:05.000
and that's all and anyone would recognize him as a second question of capturing a character.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Without a how to and then the final thing how do you do this if you don't take the obvious

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
and exaggerate that that's why I thought to try how would you recognize a friend of

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
yours a block away. And the snowstorm you would recognize him. How would you

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
do that it would be a difficult for me to explain how I would do it. As for you. It's

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
a similar problem in both cases maybe you hadn't thought about it but.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000
It's the same problem

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
actually within what would be the difference between the drawings that you do and

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
portrait or drawing as a portrait there. This is me as a

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
different Yes Well that depends on physical copying of an

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
existing thing. It's the physical things.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
The shape of the head. They know the eyes

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
the color of the head. All of that is terribly important and without it you would have

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
no portrayed and caricature. None of that is. You can leave out all

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:01.000
the

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000
features I had and still no.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Effects of the successful one a child could recognize

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
that when you have to do something to compensate for

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:19.000
this could be done with certain symbols for instance in public life.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Informing is more so than today since everyone is becoming a blob.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
But. That were in politics and in that they don't

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
distinguish personalities that you could who develop sort of trademarks

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Brian Williams Jennings Bryan had a and kind of a bird's nest in the back of

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:37.000
his

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
head that caricature a star cartoonist jumped

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
on. George M. cone and the cane chapel on

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
the Derby on the proletarian feet. You know that the George gross invented

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
the proletarian with his feet going you know all the

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
proletarian artist did

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
that because it was a recognized symbol throughout the world whether gross. Consciously

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
did that I don't know but Chaplin became the little man symbol all throughout the world and

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
some proletarian or whenever you would do a proletarian you have to have him with his feet going out like Chaplin or it was

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
not a proletariat and capitalists were pigeon

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
toed the symbols became recognizable to everyone doesn't that lead to

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
stereotypes then. Well as no and it doesn't it leads to ought all

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
the OP has form that's accepted. I mean

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
you could say that the Egyptian audience stereotyped our El Greco

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
as stereotype because all Greco painted everything in the long gated terminal with a wonderful sense

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
of caricature. As I use the word.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
But it also had a highly religious. And the

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
static. Effect on the view of.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
The nothing stereotyped about a church a stereotype but it has

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
a functional.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Architecture but I would think that the thing that distinguishes your drawings are

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000
the individuality. Other than the symbol of prison being a probably tell

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
you every aristocrat.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Except you get to learn to read symbols you know for instance the Balinese

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
have way of

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
drawing. The women they have their eyes your straight line under

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
it and round on top. The man is a straight line on top round at the

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
bottom and they the demon.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Devil is around I completely

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
circle and so this is communicable and it can be

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
read by the Balinese very easily just as we can read our people have learned to

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
read various symbols and.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
In painting and in OP What kind of symbols. Do you.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Well it's hard to say since I haven't. While

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
I say you have

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:54.000
to

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000
look because they're not whenever I do develop

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
a thing that has what you say stereotype quality I abandon it because

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
it's no good for me. I vow from

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
that another phone and otherwise I take the reader along on this kind of

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
a linear adventure. You might say that from a simple

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
spiral which would be an eye and recognizable to a child.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
I can leave out parts of the spiral and add other things to it and other words it

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
becomes a graphic problem and a very personal thing between me and

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
my pen in order to communicate what I'm trying to say

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
this sounds a little involved I know but I can't explain it any other

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
way but it's not really a conscious use the symbol then is

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
it not a conscious use of some Bowl but you can't help but bring it down to its

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
essence and that becomes a

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
symbol a.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Certain stance of a girl. Stablish or as I lay.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Straight Walker are

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
a cabaret entertain a

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
hairdo. A hat a bowler

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
McCain patent leather shoes spats

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:19.000
pearls all sorts of things that people wear are symbols.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
And they're recognizable when you put them in a drawing it immediately establishes or helps

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
establish a certain face of her character.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Well you know what you do the same thing that an actor and actress would do. I mean

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
to establish a character they have to get the right stance in the right outfit and the right hat. That's right and it's

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:37.000
very

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
similar and similar to it. Yes it's similar except that their problem is different

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
and quite obviously Mine's a graphic one on there's a speech and

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
movement but their means it was a very different.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
My suppose only means of autumn similar you know

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000
to communicate.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
An abstract idea to make it palatable and understandable to a

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
reader part to a viewer.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
How do you actually where do you start from a sitting and

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
somebody posing in front of you

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
or rational well since most of my work is the theater. Although I do quite a bit

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
of motion pictures things you know and the United oddest.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
But I might say other things that I've been more or

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
less identified with and I've been with for so long I go out of town catch the show

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.000
a week or two before it comes into New York. And make my drawings in the theater.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Another thing and I've learned across the as to draw in the dock.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
I practiced for years in drawing and subways in my pocket. You know with this

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:46.000
tiny

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
pencil and making sketches of people sitting opposite me. And

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
then after each stop when they would get out I would look at these and of course a lot of them

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
where made no sense of any kind accept to me. I could learn to

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
read them after a while and I can do that now.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
I mean that the actual drawing you do in the theater does not resemble very close no one that

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000
you do know except that certain things about it. That I I can

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
do a certain little smile are looking and I

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
are. And I

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
don't because my everyone's memory for these things

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000
is

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
as precious as it's terribly difficult to

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
maintain and the little notes that I make help me.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
I mean I can read them later.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Good day. B.C. so you don't really do the drawing that you take down the information.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Yes and if I'm stuck up if I feel that it's a difficult subject and I'm not going

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
to get it then I will go back stage and make

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
a detailed drawing of them usually in quite

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
a realistic drawing and

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
then. Show that I know exactly what they look like and then

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:06.000
later I translated into my own.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Style

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
foam do things can you can you do enough thirty realistic drawings.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Oh yeah absolutely yes yes people have a comically realistic. Yes that

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
was my training for many many I see. What makes the subject more difficult is there

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
any predictable rule on this.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
No no no rules.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Sometimes I have like a thousand drawings or someone before I get them.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Another Time to head at the first

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
time. And usually the best ones are

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000
the ones that are

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
spontaneous because they have a Spock. The others are studied

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
and become but staff never happy with them

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
but I don't know why certain problems I suppose something I

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
ate got for down.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Who's been your favorite subject since his film.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Well

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000
both You're allowed to

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000
do. And it's a kind of a mutual

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000
admiration society with Boulder he. Copies my drawings he tells

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
me that he has my drawings in a studio

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
and whenever I do a drawing

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
of he try to imitate the actual

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
movement because he feels it's so much him that then he's living up

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
to your prediction that

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
he he really takes fire at these things and tries to

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000
imitate these impossible movements of mine that I

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
rather use in my drawing.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
But of course chaplain. I don't know that I have any favorites really outside

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000
of the most

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
modern actor as. Difficult to distinguish the

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
very few that have

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
become symbols. I don't know what happens they seem to

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
change with

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:12.000
each role have the great personalities gone you think this this.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Well I know this sounds corny but. It seems that I had anyway

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
I suppose I've always been saying this but.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000
In my own field

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
as I find that people are

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
becoming to look alike more than they did

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
and everything is becoming standardized in some way and so not only

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000
unloving and thought but also in the features as a

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
great love going out and it was

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
devastating to you for your own work because new very very you know because it presents

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.000
kind of interesting problems of course the other is easier and you can make more effective drawings.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
I mean they're very I like

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:02.000
bland actors you know. The ones with the bulging eyes. And.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Thyroid conditions they Marla Robert Marley and Cheryl must tell an arsenal

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Well this kind of actor. I love to draw them and I love

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000
to watch them on the stage or

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
in pictures they're they're bigger than life somehow

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
they're explosive and wonderful but there's a kind of

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000
already in the modern actor it seems to me and

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
I suppose it reflects life in some way so it's true tonight

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
sense I think the vitality of the or the individuality

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
is individuality seems to be of no importance

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
and less importance to the individual is this is nothing new with me certainly I

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
mean nothing for found that I've noticed it just happens to be true.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000
It's interesting that since it's been stated so often that it really in the flesh and blood of

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000
the actors and actresses that this

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
is paradise not just on politics too you know they all look like

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Roman bar. And you know that is an

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
average American man there is an average and he is as you're just

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
full This was not the case when you were beginning you know

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
no no there were.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Oh sharks of I mean and wonderful types they all

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
looked everything from a very suave chef educated and

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
man to something it looked like a bundle of laundry tied in a metal you know

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
and eyebrows weren't flocked and.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Mustaches

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
and ugliness and beauty and it

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
was more it was with a

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000
modern And I suppose it's had a lot to do with the art of cosmetics

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
and also have just had a leveling out process you

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000
know. There are

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000
some books Atkinson wrote about you and I quote him here

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
and to him when he's referring to you organized life. In

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
saying nothing makes sense in point of fact the characters are reports of what he

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
sees to him the conventional portrait is the real distortion he sees life is

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
something wild and absurd in which the unexpected is the normal.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Do you think this is true you.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000
Well I don't know it's always difficult to recognise yourself. I suppose there's a certain amount

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000
of truth in

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:31.000
it from Buxus point of view.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000
If you. I mean you have to get some something to base it from you

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000
know. That I have

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
NO NO SUCH of friends who to me

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
are much screw where I had to Brook some probably shrilly but some

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.000
of my friends he would think that for a lonely Ben you know.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000
It's

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
a matter of a point of view on that I

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000
think he's Is that your two most favorite words are hilarious and insane.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Do you these a lot. I probably do i probably do. He's always check me

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
on so I must. Why have you concentrated with the

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
other is this your main love.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Well it's a way of making a living to start off with I doubt whether I would be that interested if I

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000
didn't get paid for

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
it I don't know what would have attracted me originally I mean I

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000
I might just as well of been doing characters of

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000
authors if there were a feel for that one on a

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000
person that's what I really meant. So there's not too much open ing for this kind of thing is that the idea for in

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
politics and in that you weren't an either

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
or isn't because and you see doesn't I draw a big line between what

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000
I'm doing

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000
and cartooning on political drawings they

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
want cartoons. That's not enough

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
to comment on a

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
man. In line. It has to have

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
a joke. Our point of view that has a literary point of

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000
view

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.000
and on South America is a different problem and completely it's accepted

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
from and it's a popular

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
ought to remember arriving in

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Rio down there a couple years ago had some

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
exhibitions in South America

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000
and on my own arrival I came in on the

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
same ship with Joan Crawford who was down there promoting Pepsi

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Cola and the publicity on

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
the day of our arrival. I think that I was given more space than Miss Crawford.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000
This is absolutely impossible anywhere in this country and then.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000
They magazine by the name of Cruzeiro which is the equivalent of Life

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000
magazine in South

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
America had a luncheon for me in which they invited all the

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000
caricaturist and these dollars flowing in from US Addison

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000
Montevideo and long distances never about two hundred fifty of them at

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
this luncheon. I was tremendously impressed

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000
and

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000
flattered at this reception because I didn't know this existed anywhere in the world

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
I don't suppose it does with the exception of South America where it's an accepted.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
Phone is not in this

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000
really dead. Form of their culture

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000
in some way

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
it's this doesn't exactly Iraq in Europe is as much

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
then a little more in Europe than here in

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000
French a little bit of Germany of course to a great extent. Russia

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000
has had rather. In

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000
the early twenty's wonderful caricaturist there.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000
And now it's they're copying a punch in the New Yorker.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Most of these publications actually are copying the New Yorker. They use to copy some posters almost a

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000
German

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
publication that had some first rate caricaturist on it. George gross and go buy

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000
a song Pass

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:20.000
can and Tony and high and wonderful man.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000
But in recent years as a yacht in Germany is hardly worth even considering

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000
it's produced nothing is at least to my knowledge a has any.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Real spark. Have you traveled throughout Europe or not in America have you thought of

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
doing drawings of their theater and their movies

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
and I did drawing some theatre while I was down

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000
there in Brazil and ago I

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000
and.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Is there a great difference in nationality in the personalities and the visual aspects

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000
of stall Yes Yes They're wonderful to

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
draw you know wonderful to draw

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000
on but they have one of the most

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:11.000
Latins have as you well know I mean the kind of a.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
Less inhibited than the Anglo-Saxon and it shows in their face there and

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
then their movements their spring here and their exaggerated and all of their

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000
movements and

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000
expressions and it's easier and more fun to capture this kind

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
of thing you're very interested in movement aren't you even though it yes

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
avick Yes it's amazing how much movement you get into your

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000
drawings very much so yes I don't necessarily mean jumping or

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000
running but I mean sitting in a chair the way somebody holds a cigarette

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:49.000
are the movement of the body or a finger.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000
That's also as you can get a sense of fun and action out of

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000
it how you've been speaking about a greater

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000
standardization on the part of actors and. Actress's How do you feel about the plays that

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000
are being produced now versus the ones fifteen twenty twenty years ago.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000
Well I think most of the plays were fifteen twenty twenty years ago are not worth reviving

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000
really with the exception I mean there were great works of art a rare one everyone expects everything to be

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000
a

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000
great work of art as is asking too much of the artist.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:22.000
If we

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.000
have two good players a year. I think that's about top

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000
of the course and it always has

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000
been what is the satisfaction you get out of your work. What

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000
do you enjoy about it most well advanced in the money.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000
I do you're going to say that.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000
Well I like to be busy I like to work.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000
I don't I'm not a vacation man I'm not an awful lot of man I don't

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000
go in for any of these things and I get my fun out of

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000
working all reading. I enjoy it.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Do you think you will continue with theatrical personalities I mean this is where you are this is

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000
where you'll stay.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000
I think so I have no other plans of any kind and I never had plans to do that

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000
you know I suppose if nobody phoned me and asked me to do a drawing of somebody

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000
I would do something

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.000
else you know but I don't see how you can in my particular case

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000
at any rate I can't divorce her from the economics of staying alive.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000
Well that's very wise I hope

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000
you don't we like you around. I want to thank

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000
