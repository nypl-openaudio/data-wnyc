00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Misandry I like to begin by discussing some the problems you raised in A Raisin in the sun and

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I want you so that everyone will know what we're talking about you be kind enough to describe the story briefly.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Well what it involves is an examination of

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
a family South Side of Chicago where I was born

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
to belong to the lower classes a family of domestic

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
workers who I hope are fairly typical of people

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
who think that there is something more to do with your life

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and accept it as it is. The young son becomes

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
the what we call the today as of drama and his ambition is

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
to accepting American values and their

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
totality to become a successful businessman but very simply

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
the mother and the his wife want to get home so there's a

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
conflict between the

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
two in terms of a statement I think with the play that tries to say is

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
that we really don't have very much in the world at all if we allow

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
any aspect of money values to transcend the requirements that are

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
necessary for human dignity.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
You said that the play is a great deal about dreams dreams deferred

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
dreams realized why there are certain kinds of dreams or right and certain kinds of dreams that are wrong in

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
my opinion yet. Which of course

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
is my opinion I'd I. I for one simply can't get

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
terribly excited about anyone who wants to commit their lives to just making

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
money as an end in itself I can't

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
understand it if someone can give me an appreciation of it. Then perhaps I

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
would but at this moment in my life. I happen to think a

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
life that has as its end something.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Of service from Purpose village of mother with the making shoes or writing books.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Plays

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
or being an engineer but has some end product is a far

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
more substantial life than someone who have somehow gotten let into the way

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
of thinking that tells him that money is the reason why we

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.000
live

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
the younger people in the family were consumed with material benefits were the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
same material goods that you were saying that perhaps the message in the play is that this kind of concern

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
is not enough is that correct.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Well I think that all value of ultimately come out of materialistic approach to

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
life yes but there is no such thing as simply saying to people not

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
being nice.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
That you can't be nice if you're living miserably and you can't be anything except very much concerned about how

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
to live better right. So that to that extent all life. I think has

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
a materialistic base under your In other words it is marvelous people to have a

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
clean

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
home only does it relevant for them to have two television sets. There's a there's a vast

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
difference and I don't and. I hope that that kind of materialism isn't linked with

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.000
what I'm talking

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
about so after the bare minimum is remote and there are other things that

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
are more important. Yes I think so but isn't mamma the embodiment of this kind

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
of ideal when she seems to value

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
principle of our profit years. Yes much of what

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
she has to say and much of her inspiration in this

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
family is toward a principled and some the best

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
kind I think but you can't just dismiss everything because you have an

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
objective to do something in the world but you have to emerge as a human

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
being and stature as wife characterized her my own mind as a great

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
woman. Yes. Well we see this emphasis

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
on material gain say Walter the central figure has Do

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
you think by necessity there will be a loss in this kind of moral backbone and old fashioned virtue.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
You mean if they become middle class family yes. Well no I don't think so. I

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
think there are other dangers but I don't I don't think particularly that.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000
The middle class loses its notion of virtue or loses other things.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
What the the transition may mean a certain attraction.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Ultimately to a lot of the meaningless parts of

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
comfort. That one must have two cars

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
or a car of a certain make that the children

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
must address a certain way or that particular in terms of

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
negro questions of course but. A

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
tendency which already exists in the Negro middle class to want to disassociate.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
The middle class from what is really the most

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
exciting and vibrant part of negro culture which is that it's working class and

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
the Blues spiritual great yes I'll talk. Art and

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Culture and the

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Negro people you see

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
they have had in the past it's beginning to diminish. It's now an artistic You see they

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
get a little arty now to appreciate it in

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
reverse and yes always Japanese like you know German leader has become.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
An art song in the concert hall

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
before everyone can universally say well my word is this mob of well that happens.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
I know that you said that science will bring more rewards for our generation

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
than mysticism does mean that you place faith in a very rational

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
scientific approach to existence now rather than the traditional your religious believing

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
and of the model.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Yes I do I think that

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
to use anything anything new has happened since

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
rationalism burst

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
forth with the Renaissance and the subsequent developments

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
in rational thought that the only time we revert back

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
to mystical ideas which includes most

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
contemporary orthodox religious views and my.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
It's because we simply are confronted with some things we don't yet understand so we start all over

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
again what people were doing two thousand years ago and things well you see because we don't

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
know that from the US. Therefore there is some

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
other agent but we'll never find out I don't

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
find how that follows. I think it's simply a question of things we don't yet

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
know yet in the case of mama she gets so much sustenance from this this

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
kind of yes a yes for those on the glories of man that the inventiveness of

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
the human mind and the human

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
spirit that whenever life. Doesn't seem to give an answer we

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
create them but it gives us strength. I don't attack people who

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
are religious at all as you can tell from play a rather

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
minor the human quality to make their own questions as long

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
as we need them. The only thing I'm saying is that want to be can walk. You know and drop

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
them but actually you believe in a kind of increase in moral and philosophical

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
strength by the use of reason only is yes. I don't believe there will be. I don't think the

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
time will ever come when we will dismiss the human spirit I don't think there's any contradiction and we

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:12.000
don't

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
need mysticism to absolve man man exalts himself by

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
his his achievements and his power to rationalize or

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
excuse me his power

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
to reason as

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
his rationalization has its benefits so I don't know if we can get along without that

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
it

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
is very interesting because in the play as you write it the younger generation is no

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
stronger even with their advanced reason they don't seem as strong as the mom

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
or is this intentional on your part.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Oh well but actually they are you

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
say. Another words I

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000
think it

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
would be a very quick inclination

00:07:59.000 --> 00:07:59.000
of beneath.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
To wish to function as a citizen of the world. You know and to go

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
to the United Nations and try to affect the

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000
political life of for a

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
nation. Rather than pray for me I think

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
this enormous development very positive one over the past I don't mean

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
that mamma wasn't an effective force in the past she was obviously she left out

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
she felt she had to do something

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
but the less

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
dependent attitude on Providence. I think is this is a trial.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
I can say that strongly people say that there is no difference between today and

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
the past of course there is of course each generation brings a

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000
triumph

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
of rationality. There's an enormous difference between. The

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Greeks from the Romans there was a time when people thought was perfectly all right old lives even though we exult So you

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
know so-called Greek democracy today the fact was matter was a slave society and

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
today we would not think that this is a proper thing to admit to even if going and

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
secretly as a

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
dozen or covertly in certain parts of the world human morality.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Now negates that you're saying that we can take much smaller

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
evidences forty years ago nobody thought women should vote today they do You couldn't

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000
really run for office

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
today saying that you were going to stamp out the suffrage of women those are all

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000
achievements we rarely think of

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
a dubious achievement.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
You have faith and then we will have

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
reason or you have a reason and. So position here that through

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
increased rationality men will behave better towards

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
men. Oh yes I think there's been every evidence of that in history by the rise

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
of Germany in the US and all of that you can

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
say well this Denise which is the sister

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
of the young man who has these dreams of. Financial

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
success seem to look to Africa for a

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
sense of identity. Do you find that this is appealing to you to

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
me personally

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
as well by look to that. Has to be

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
clarified and what is really almost a

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
philosophical sense it's true I think that negro intellectuals and grow

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
artists are profoundly attracted once again

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.000
but there's a rebirth of that feeling.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Has to do with the reassertion of the of the possibility that what we

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
currently call the Western world is

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
not necessarily the universe and that perhaps we must take a

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
more respectful view of the fight but African leaders today say that

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
with regard to Europe and European traditions in the world that we will take

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
the best of what your perspective and the best of what we have produced

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
and and try to create a superior civilization out of the census.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
I agree with them and I think that that commands respect

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
for what will be inherently African and

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
that contribution. What do you think

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000
the tradition of Africa is meaningful to.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
American Negro born and brought up here knowing very little about Africa just as most as every

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
American knows very little.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Is it meaningful yes only because of the peculiar history of American Negroes which has been one

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
of oppression. You see that the without intellectual understanding of

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
African culture and I. You're quite correct that just doesn't exist. Nobody hardly

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
knows where it is on the map or right until

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
recently what there was was emotional can

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
ship use it because. For obvious reasons you know

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
people who really honestly didn't know where or which

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
part which was East African which was West Africa you know but. Of Kenya as being in West

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Africa still has this profound emotional can ship. In

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
spite of you know so many years and years

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
of contrary kinds

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
of reformation about it this is certainly still exists and

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
it's yeah strong and it is it's getting much stronger. I

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
think I know that you were twenty seven when you wrote

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
to supply and you said

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
that perhaps one of the reason why so many current Negro writers are so

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
young and that they have so much say they started

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
earlier. What do you feel that they have to

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000
say

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000
or that was a smart aleck you quote to prove that I still have a little

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
bit Meath in May but I think what

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
I meant. Aside from the fun of it was the Negro Artist

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
a negro a writer and to killer does have a particular vantage point which is a little different from

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
the white writer we have so many people have remarked in the original as me have

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:02.000
the

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
peculiar stance of being within and without

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
a culture at the identical moment you see of existence but we're never really

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
quite in to the

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
mainstream and yet we are obviously. Tyrolese

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
completely American and in every way conditioned and I thinking as Americans

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
and so on so that many of the things which puzzled other

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
people it seems to me.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Stand out in more bold relief to us some of the values. Some of the contradictions.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Some of the goodies that we most longed for and what not and another part of us we've

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
already judged you know I have already seen their

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
emptiness and some of the really marvelous things that other people don't pay that much attention to we know

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
how precious they are you know when you speak of civil rights civil

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
liberties that. We know that these are not things to be

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
toyed with because we're still just barely getting out.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
I this is for you what are you trying to achieve through your own

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
writing while

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
trying to achieve. Well. I

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
suppose I

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
think about Hyacinth Yes

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
but

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
man has his art and I am audacious enough to think

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
of myself as an

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
artist.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
But there is both joy and beauty

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
and illumination and

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
communion between people to be achieved through

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
the dissection of personality. That's what I want to do

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:52.000
I want to reach a little closer to the world which is to say to people.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
And see if we can shift from a lumination to gether about each

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
other this is where you are speaking of the desire

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:06.000
to communicate what do you ask of a play what you asked to play do.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
First of all I think I like for it to activate my imagination. I like very much to

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
sit back together and feel that I'm going to be transported

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
out of my own narrow

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
confines of the human being in speaking of what you ask to play then it

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
partly to move you. Yes I happen to believe very much that it should

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
move you. I think you must feel something about what you are

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
consuming. Otherwise you can walk down the street and see any number but set

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
against all of us being callous as we are by the facts of our life.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Don't have any reaction to it

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
because there's been no preparation no compulsion on our part

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
to participate in a crisis. You know so that you just pass the blind man

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000
somewhat so but if you are involved on the station the fact of how he got blind

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
its relationship to other people because he. Blind

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
of his needs and tendencies this ability to involve the audience

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
or viewers in the scene. Do you consciously I think that when I'm writing this

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
this is going to an involved. How do you stay dramatic moment how do you say my

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000
strong very good question that no one else

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
has ever asked and. That's very good. I

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000
suppose I would have

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000
to to think more carefully when I was working to really answers. Honestly

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
I I'm sitting here and to hear it I'm not that sure.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Do you see this drama in everyday experience as you're walking along the street or wherever

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
the yes but. I happen to believe

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
that most people and that's where I differ from many of my contemporaries or at least as they express themselves.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:46.000
I think

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
that virtually every human being is dramatically interesting not only is he

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
dramatically interesting. He is a creature of stature whoever he is Mencken

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
said in journalism that there are no dull subjects there are only

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:06.000
doll writers. This is probably very very true.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
And dramatic material that most people have was in them the

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
core of their conflicts which give them stature if the

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
writers able to probe it.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Do most people. Resolve these conflicts in a way that Dustin's don't you don't you know. This.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Well of well that's the beauty of the question

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
because it's in the struggle to overcome a

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
problem whether it ends in failure or what we might call for lack of a better

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000
word success that people exhibit their possibilities as

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000
being you know Hamlet

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.000
sales but does he so you would say that most people have there's a potential for stature.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Or that they only have it. Yes they have it within them to do that right. But

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
the but the drama to what the artist can do

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000
that other people don't think to do in the course of. It's to wonder

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
about all that the elements of it you know. I felt that you know

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:12.000
the fact of getting up and going to work every day is a monument to tribute.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:12.000
To the average

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000
human but it really is you see and if you did you'd dissected then and treated

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:24.000
with all the conflicts that the man has just getting out of the bed that short story.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
The things that must pass through his mind the responsibilities the weight the maybe the worst work

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000
at the office you know or

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000
the factory. He's not at that moment in time what he has

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
done just to get out of bed and get out and quite a saying

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000
this is Brad like to ask a rather large question what do you get out of writing.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
That is

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000
large it's also balance.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
And some measure I guess what I said before a sense of participation in my

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
time and what I call my world. The people that

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.000
I create give a great deal back.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000
I'm very very lucky of course to be only approaching. Thirty one

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
of the moment and had the opportunity to. You

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000
know see it put before many people and have

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000
their reaction to it and there is nothing yet that has been written I

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
don't think in poetry or that has quite articulated the

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
gratification of that I don't know how one

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000
can know it probably is the most fulfilling experience a human

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
being can I don't mean just to write but I mean

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
to to try and create something and I haven't received any measure

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
of recognition for the work. So that I can only

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
said in personal terms I get enormous sense of personal fulfillment.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
A slight sense of just occasion to be.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Meeting the people that you create. Something that to you how do you mean that you're involved with

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
the characters themselves and grow with us Will they argue with

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
me in the best traditions that writers are always talking that isn't just I'm artsy

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
craftsy thing they really do talk back to you and yet you're angry

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
and they really do have a lot

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
have ideas of their own I suppose what I'm trying to say is that to the extent that I

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
have evolved any. What I can only

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
call grandly. Philosophical notions as a whole comes from the process

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000
of conversation

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000
with people in life and also through the struggle

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000
of trying to create people who are true. So that it's pretty much the

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
same process they do argue with you they demand that you prove your

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
point foreseen to be true. I want

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000
to close with two personal questions first and quite simple factual one what are

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000
your plans for the future what are you intending to work on

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000
next three years ago or four years ago whenever it was I had

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
written follow plays. And I said

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
little but there were three place and I started out. Never having

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
written a play in my life. Third Act

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
play three act plays which was a hangover from my painting days when I

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
never could start anything other than you know the

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
whole thing at one time you know

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
just into it very big I want to continue the process.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
I want to continue just typing things and writing plays all the way

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000
out and those but I think have some merit. I will dare to

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
read to other people as I find a day to read that the

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
one. On from there I kept think

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:50.000
of any part of the world. I'm not sure how this sounds but it's what I feel.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
And I can't think of any part of the world that doesn't intrigue me and that I would like to try and deal with

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
I want to try and deal with the drama and deep in my heart of course like every writer I would like

00:21:59.000 --> 00:21:59.000
to write and.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
The final question I want to ask you was raised in the sun was about dreams.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000
I wonder what your dream is. Well my

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
dream. Is largely outside of

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
myself. Which is a happy thing to be able to say but it

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000
is I don't feel especially compulsive

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
about keeping up with anything or anybody in terms of career or anything like

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
that I've really think I'm in the process of living my dream I'm able to

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
work freely with.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000
Not a great deal of insecurity materially to use our word.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000
On what I want to work on and to do the things I want to do terms of

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:53.000
activities so that there isn't anything. I spiration ill and that's.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000
And which is why so that most of my dream is outside of myself I would like very

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
much. To live in a

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000
world where some of the more

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000
monumental problems could at least be solved I'm thinking of

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000
course peace.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
That's part of my dream that we don't fight. Nobody fights we get rid of all the

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000
little bombs and the big

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000
bomb and then just all the

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
other things that encompass human

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000
questions and I think on that note I'd like to close and thank you very

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000
much for years and alike. You're quite welcome I've enjoyed it very much.
