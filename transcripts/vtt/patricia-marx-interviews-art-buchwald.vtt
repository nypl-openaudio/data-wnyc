00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This is the question marks. My guest today is a man who's been called the most comic

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
American since Mark Twain. He's Mr I thought called a columnist for The New York Herald

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Tribune and all three of the recent book I chose capital

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
punishment to Buffalo Did you always right as you do now.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Well in a sense I did I never wrote too seriously.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
You know they say

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that your own words usually have a happy childhood and

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I guess in my case that might be true. So an early age

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I sort of had a kind of a different outlook on things than most

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
other kids did and I profited from it or make use

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
of

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
it in what we do have a different attitude.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Well I saw things I explained I was a force to child and

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I was one of the outs and I failed all the other kids were named. And I made

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
up my mind early in life that I was an

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
out on the outside looking

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
man. And therefore I just thought of everything I did

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.000
was kind

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
of guy looking at other people rather than

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
participating

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and. It worked because

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I found I could get attention. Early in life as as a

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
child by making other people

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
laugh so that really the same kind of thing as of your writing I mean I

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
was always Yeah I was always making fun of the teacher

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
or the teacher was the establishment as a time I think to

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
me I think I've always been against the

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
establishment whatever it is and I think most humorous should be against the

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
establishment who's ever who's ever in power who's

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
ever whichever's the right thing to do you know you should

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
be against Why.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Because I have feeling that we get. A little too serious about our

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
establishments and we've taken too seriously and you have to

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
keep putting pens in these balloons to bring people down to

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
earth and it's the job of the omer is

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
to stick the pen. Into the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
balloon and do. Well.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Lee I usually do better by examples and I recently wrote a column

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
about

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Barry Goldwater wanted to sell the T.V. A and I

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
thought it was a good idea as I said I think I'll buy it for my son. So I went

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
down to the government office here and asked if I could buy the T.V. and they said it wasn't

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
for sale yet because they have to wait after the election.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
But they did offer to sell me the Grand Coulee

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Dam and I didn't want that and then they offered me a family

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
car and I said it was a little too far from home for the kid. So then they offered

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
to sell me the capital and I said no that was too near the

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
corm were all the Bobby Baker stuff has been going on and we

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
finally settled on a Naval Academy in

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Annapolis and I bought him that for Christmas but the boy I'm trying

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
to make

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
as. You get something as ridiculous

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
as go or saying he wants to sell T.V. and then you

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
just make it more ridiculous. So you take a dream is true and then you go from

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
there everything every all

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
my articles have a germ of truth. They have

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
to what is indignation the source of inspiration for the articles.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Well I say hostility is a form of human and one of the big formal you know we're

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
getting hostility. And I guess indignation would fit in with the still of a

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
I get

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
angry at a lot of things are going on and I get angry at the stupidity said I see

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
around me and forcefully I'm able to get these out of my system

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and what is supposed to be the most way and also a lot of. People feel the same way

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
I do but they're not able to say it the way I do

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
so they get they get their charge out of it through.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
The tone of your article there was no hostile.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
No it's not. Stuff I try to make it kind and the

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
underlying thing there is truth and not beauty

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
just truth.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And then another example I could cite would be the UNICEF thing on how I

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000
was

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
now I was over the friend's house and he got a call from a woman who said Do

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
you know that your eight year old son is out collecting money for a

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
communist organization because he was around with one of these little cartons for

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
UNICEF collecting money for children's fund and my friend

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
said That's terrible he says I don't go out and break

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
windows and spoke garbage on the lawns but I didn't think he'd go that far as to collect

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
money for a Children's Fund. So the whole article was this guy thanking

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
the lady for calling him

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and saying his son was a terrible boy for going around doing those terrible

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
things but I had a lot when I wrote that when I originally heard of the call I got so

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
mad at this woman who is who you know kids

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
are stopping from throwing rocks and breaking land they don't something

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
constructive and yet these creeps around the country think

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
it's it's against.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
The rules to if you're collecting money for an organization that are for children all over the

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
world. Are there any particular things that get you most angry or is it. These kind

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
of idiocies wherever they

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
are well mostly idiocies wherever they

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
are not actually the big

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
things that I get angry. But I never like

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
to let on that I'm angry. For example the negro question.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
I get angry at that I feel that nobody is

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.000
doing or very few people are doing the right thing by this integration saying.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And it made me think what's going on today in several parts of America

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
we used to say to the Germans when they were killing all these Jewish

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
people. Didn't you know what was going on

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
didn't you know and all the. People said no we didn't know where in America

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
we seem to be you know what's going on but we don't seem to be doing too much about

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
it and but I got to be funny about

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
it I did a column not too long ago

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
as have been segregated because while US was asked that question governor

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
once was asked is having was segregated and he thought it

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
was and I

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
thought. I thought

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
it was and I thought that's why it was in heaven because the white people would have to do their

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
own laundry and do all the menial jobs that the Negroes have to do. There wouldn't be much of

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000
a have

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
and so I do I must admit I am and I agree

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
man on the surface I try

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
to put on a front. Are you a reformer.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Well. Or is a form of reform. I don't I want to

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
be reformed. I do know that in the UNICEF article I did have

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000
a lot of

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
people you know I just made things so ridiculous

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
that I may have helped a little UNICEF that

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
I have in the mail from the people that man indicated I

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000
may have helped.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
So yes that guy's a weapon. Everything's a weapon and you

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
try to use it as best you can and just say enough I

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
mean is Michael years behind the Iron Curtain a

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
lot and there's a pick on one which is very critical of the American government and I'm

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
delighted that they use these pieces because. Shows that we do have freedom of

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.000
expression over here and we can do it I know when I was in Russia.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:08.000
I was

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
this crocodile a human magazine and they had just printed my face

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
bad me attacking Haggerty and I got a attacking

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
me. An article I

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
wrote and they said I was very funny and I said to them

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Well can you follow the tiger show and they said well why would

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
we attack cruise ship when he came to Washington from Paris. You were warned that

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
it's all right to make fun of the French but is a different thing making fun of the Americans now do you have any

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
difficulty with this.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Not too much. I receive a lot more mail here than I

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
do and here because the blare seem to care more about things and you can step

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
on toes. Very easily and every organization under

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
the sun has a lobbying organization you can attack the church you can

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
attack dentists you can attack

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
this without hearing from a lobbyist or some public relations guy you know saying what we

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:03.000
do wrong.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
And so you do find everybody is very sensitive here. In

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
the interest of personal to the interests. But I do at the same

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
time I've discovered that people are very grateful for you and

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:20.000
I picked

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
up a newspaper since I've been the United States more than I have in Europe because people

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
were delighted to read about Europe but it was still a very low

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
rated audience compared to what I've got and it's not easy to write but there's not too

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
many people don't it's I'm grateful for that.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
How do you find Washington you find it very provincial

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
after well it was up until a Bobby Baker scandal. Now it sounds the

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:45.000
be a

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
real swinging place. You have to pass

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
it is very provincial places. I've always told people I

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
find Washington's fun in the daytime and a real bore and I find

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Paris was fine with. I mean fun at night.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Why didn't you come to New York.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
I don't know your age is just it's too hard to pin

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
down anything in New York.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Is that fun at night. Yeah it is fun at night the Charlie arc is the doing it's in the

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
case the subject matter New York just didn't seem to lend

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
itself as much as Washington to what I want to do which was that is it

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
difficult to appeal to such a wide audience.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
I was amazed myself because when I wrote some parents I was well printed

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
abroad and when I moved to Washington I said to several editors of different

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
papers abroad. I guess you'll be dropping to come and I said No I'm much more interested

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
in Washington and we are in Paris. So Washington is of interest all over the world.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Everybody wants know what's going on

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
and if you keep the subject matter fairly open

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
to local people understand it it doesn't seem to be too much of

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
a problem but the thing is I don't have

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
to go after sources I don't need source of news

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
sources and I don't have to have lunches with people I don't

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
have to be at the White

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
House I don't have to be up on the Hill talking to people. Therefore I don't have to

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
cultivate all these people and that's what prevents me from

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
being on the end everything in Washington is done with a

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
reason and the people are conflict cultivating the press comes of a surprise as

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000
a politician cultivate the press and I've been able to identify as I really don't need.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:34.000
I do EVERY don't

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
need these people I make everything out what it does.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Well what Bobby Baker is and I opened up a whole

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
can of beans in this town and probably in the United States and I

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
don't think there would have been a Bobby Baker scanners that hadn't been a perfume a scandal.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:58.000
So I think we owe it to Mr Professional know not to miss performer but to that. Scandal.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
What made this one a little more.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Interesting you think ice is

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
good I think it will be before it's finished

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
because there's a lot of sex involved in Washington

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
a lot a lobbyist here a lot of call girls. Things

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
that nobody ever talked about here was

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
suddenly the Bobby Baker scandal has opened up a can of beans and you're going to

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
discover like there is an area to

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
have a certain amount of vice and no way talks about it until

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:29.000
some

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
scandal puts it out in the open and everybody goes back again and everybody gets very

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
indignant about it and then I go back

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
to the way it was

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000
before you think there's any more vice here and there is anywhere else.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
No but the trouble is the government's located here. And you

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
have license powers and you have lice in London and the reason it was a big scandal in London is that there was

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
government people involved and Downey had a reason why it's such a big scandal is because

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
it's government people involved in nobody knows

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
what roles all these people played

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
in getting government contracts and spending taxpayers' money plus

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
the fascination that everybody has with the scandal

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
and you have to I have a fascination

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
about reading about it I don't have too much about writing about it but I am

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
fascinated reading about a good scandal.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
What do you think of the investigations which ones get well in the Bobby

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Baker

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
investigation because they haven't come to any

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
conclusions I have a feeling that they are trying to stay away from all of the moral stuff and stick

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
with the business side of the body because saying and whether their

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
sex scandal part will

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
get involved. We don't know.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.000
You see what happened in prosumer case is that Ward was tried.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
If you recall for something I forget what

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
was heard during the regular perjury. And that

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
suddenly gave everybody a chance to question all these witnesses like Christine

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Keeler now at the moment you don't have any

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
criminal charges against anybody Baker is involved in

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
a suit a civil so concerning

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
the serve you.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Vending Machine Company.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
So there wouldn't be a real chance to call a lot of witnesses

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
unless somebody committed perjury or somebody to make it a crime that they wanted to

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
get hanged somebody for and so you may not

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000
have the scandal that you did have an approximate case unless one person in

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
all these different areas gets gets

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
tried you think there's too much indignation involved with this.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Well I always feel

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
like there is a tremendous amount of indignation shown by Americans

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
about anything to do with scandal.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
I was talking to a friend of mine you have a date is maybe a very farfetched

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
added to the mind but I say every day all of the United States some wife is stealing

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
some has been to some has been standing some life.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Nobody in the community gets too upset about the you know it's just the nature of gossip

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
but then somehow I was in Washington and everybody

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000
said very outrageous and indignant about it and I think it's

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
fairly hypocritical. I think it is an awful lot of stuff going

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
on in the United States and having lived in Europe there's an awful lot of stuff going

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000
on in the

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
world and the only people that I do dislike or the hypocrites

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
who who you know who skirts on

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:48.000
to clean themselves but like to go and fingers somebody else.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
How do you feel about expense

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.000
accounts mine. I think everyone else.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
I believe in my heart and I believe in spending.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
You know when you get into expense accounts are you referring to the tax five

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000
expense account thing.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Well the recent criticism of expense accounts say New York City with the

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
entertainment and restaurants

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
and not that expensive

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
because. I think people should be allowed to spend a lot of money brings

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000
employment and helps people and you want to luxury.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
This country's going downhill because we're losing all the luxury things because people just don't have the money

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
to spend anymore.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000
And I and I think expense accounts are one of the things that have least given us

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
good restaurants and given as good places to go and

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
everything and it's a luxury class and I'm not against him I think

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
we should have expense accounts your four lectures. I sure am.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
What about materialism that Americans are always criticised by Europeans for the

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
by not materialistic. Yes

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
well unfortunately. I would say

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
that the Americans could be criticized for materialism but I'm for say

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000
the Europeans are going right

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
along with us now and doing everything that we've

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:16.000
done credit cards. You know. Charge accounts.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Snack

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
bars hamburgers a lot and everywhere where they've opened these places they've had

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
big successes with them and they shows a deer appears want the same things we do which

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
is kind of tragic I guess but I don't I wouldn't call it American materialism I'd call

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
it well materialism. It just

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000
is it boils down to the fact that if your wife as a choice

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
is scrubbing clothes with her hands and putting my washing

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
machine. She wants the washing machine and this is what materialism

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000
is there somebody goes out to lunch and they don't want to spend two hours at lunchtime or they'd rather

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
spend fifteen minutes eating a hamburger and then shopping the other

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
the rest of the time. Well that's materialism to in a sense.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
So I don't think. Materialism

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000
is because of America's problem I think is the world's problem.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
What about conformity. They say Americans are conformist.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
I would say so I

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000
think. We don't like to be a

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
little different than anybody and I try to be non-conformist in

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
my writing and I think that's was it appeals to people is it I do

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
it tactic conformities of

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
things but yet and in those communities in suburbia

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
and boy you don't like to get online too far you just don't have any neighbors and you

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:39.000
feel

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
strange how do you live.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
I've been I don't live in suburbia here but I've

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
been out Momo friends' homes and it's scary.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
I'd rather live in a big city.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Are you a political activist you can take

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000
partisan politicians and now

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
on I probably would lean towards a Democrat if anybody because they're less

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
boring than the Republicans but I don't.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Striking fighter for because I don't see

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000
too much difference in the parties I think the Democrats have some of the worst

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000
people in the United

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000
States in the party and the Republicans have some of the

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000
best and so I don't think

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
one party is any better than the I think these are good people and bad people both parties and I

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000
just can't seem to take a stand as far as one political party against the

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
other which before there's been a lot of talk in America about the salmon in the

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
state and that women should get out of the hole and get involved in work.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000
What do you think about this.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Well. Hile now I

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000
think you know I think women should stand

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
if they want to run for president that's one thing but.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000
But I and they want to go up in a spaceship to the moon I think they should be

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000
allowed to go but otherwise I think they should be allowed to stay in the home.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
The cello in

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
a marker is very very critical I just

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
realized is that to say little girls all the way up to a high

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000
school and college

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
that they have a role to play and they're very important and they're supposed to have all

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000
these opportunities that men have and everything. Said after they get finished college or

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000
high school they get married and they wind up in

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000
a house and have to do all the chores and all the cooking and everything and every woman is supposed

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
to do and they find this is not very satisfying after they've been

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000
told that there's so many great things waiting for him at the end of the rainbow.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
So they become very dissatisfied with their life and very dissatisfied with their husbands

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000
and very dissatisfied

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000
with what we consider love

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000
quotes and the movie version of their life is certainly not the one that

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
they're living and that's what I think is a many divorces.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
What's the remedy not to teach women

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
anything I would teach him teach him that they're going to

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
be mothers and I thought they were going to be winds and it's good to

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
know a lot about books and a lot about things but at the end of the road

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
no matter what your day Jim I would warn him that

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000
this their life

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
is going to be

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
just a housewife and a mother. And that's the way it

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000
is and if they don't want to they can be something else

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000
but I think we

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
don't we don't want to kids what they're in for when they get mad we just you know we

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000
just prepare them for something that they have no that they're not going to

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.000
do is this is a worldwide movement to let me just in Paris.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000
It's much less in the

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
Latin countries because women are still kept down quite a bit. It's coming slowly.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
But still a man's world and in Italy and Spain and

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
France and women don't seem to mind the row have a good

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000
time but she's an American and she

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
was actually a career girl before I married her and she she she's good.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
She doesn't like the real thing oust wife and mother.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
How did you like being described in your column that she hopes she

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
says she has a mind she knows where bread is buttered.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
This book called A couple of questions about your own personal tastes who have been your

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.000
heroes Ring Lardner was are you Margaret the largest worker

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
in mind Bob bench these were Jim Their

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
most humorous writers.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
I was very impressed when I was a kid by

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Steinbeck you don't mention Twain.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
I know because I read Tom Sawyer and

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Huckleberry Finn but I'm one of the few guys that had much more fun out of ten right in

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
both Star Kingdom.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000
I'm a nerd. As far as Twain goes but then again

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000
I might say I'm an expert on human. I don't you don't get much

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000
snow about eight or nine years ago I stopped reading all humans because

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
I discovered every good idea in the world has been done already by somebody else. And when

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
I read these guys I wouldn't do

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000
it myself so I stopped reading them and now I don't feel guilty about any idea because I think it's

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
mine because from a very wise.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.000
Yeah you can get shattered by. Other people's stuff

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000
that every good idea in the world

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
has been done by somebody and better. What would have you done if you didn't do

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000
this I am though I did I went to the universe's California fine

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
going to Europe by my one of them how I was writing.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000
What do you think you'll go from here when you leave capital punishment.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:01.000
Well I made up my mind I kept my apartment in Paris. So I might go back to Paris and. And.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Stay there but I am I when I am I stay here too. It depends if

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000
I'm not mentioned in the Bobby Baker scandal. Stay

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000
here to vote but I'd like to close the interview with you reading a piece from your recent book

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000
I kill is capital

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000
punishment Alright well one of the things that

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000
people always seem to enjoy that I wrote had to do with the

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000
both fighting and marriage and

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000
I said everyone read something different into a ball fight usually both fighting

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000
is associated with

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000
death but I went to a fight and Dax with a recently divorced friend who insisted

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000
both fighting has more to do with marriage than anything else to me he said it

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:43.000
is the

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:48.000
complete drama of wedlock how that I ask him. Let

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000
us start at the beginning before us we see the beautifully dressed

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000
Matador he represents the bride slim confident completely in

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
charge of the situation now luck the ball has just come into

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
the ring he is the groom he is magnificent.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
But the wilted confused and sorry he is there

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000
the crowd is cheering. Why because it is a wedding

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000
day and people always cheer at weddings.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000
Now the ball is snorting and charging. But the matador always the

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000
case she is playing with him making him think he has the upper hand.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000
But what the matador is really doing is finding out the balls weaknesses and

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000
also making him use up all his energy. What's happening now.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
I asked him trying to look at the bull fight through his

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
eyes. The trumpets have sounded the wedding ceremony is over and now

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
the marriage begins in earnest First come the picture Dawes they represent

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000
the wife's relatives.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000
The bowl of Sirius but the peccadilloes keep stabbing him in the neck and shoulders

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000
and pretty soon the bull can hardly lift. Zines I see what you're driving at

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000
I said Now come the bandolero

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000
those who represent the wife's friends. They also are there to

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000
weaken the bull's muscles and make him bleed some

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000
more by this time he can keep its head up. This is the

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000
final act watch carefully the matador wife is no longer playing with

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000
the ball. Now she is serious she holds the right

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
cloth and like a full the bull makes a pass at it then he makes

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000
another he never charges the matador only the claw the

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
bull doesn't know it but he's wearing

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.000
himself out. He's in pretty desperate condition anyway after what the relatives

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000
and friends have done to him but he is angry and this is a last gasp

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:47.000
on his

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000
part. The more the matador makes a full of the bull the more the crowd

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000
cheers the crowd is always on the side of the wife just like in real

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000
life I said we are ready for the moment of truth. The boy

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
heard the world and untied looks of the man

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000
adore the matador stand in front of him and now she plunges a sword

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000
deep into his car. The Bulls staggered for several minutes in shock and

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000
then collapses the marriage is finished and the matador wife

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000
is presented with the

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000
bull's ears and tail which he holds up in the ring to

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:30.000
everyone what do the ears and tail represent. I have my friend.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000
He looked at me with the saddest eyes I had ever seen

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000
and replied alimony. Thank you Mr

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000
I well.
