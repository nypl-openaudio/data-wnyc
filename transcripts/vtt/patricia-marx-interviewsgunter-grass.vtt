00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Lighted to have as my guest today the German author Mr Going to grass. Who is considered by

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
many to be the foremost novelist of the post-war world. Author of The Tin

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Drum cat and

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
mouse and the soon to be translated third novel. Mr Grass is also a graphic

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
artist sculptor playwright and poet. Here to assist with the

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
interview and any translating which may be needed is Mr John Simon who is still a critic of the

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Hudson review and has written a critique of Mr grass' novel The Tin Drum for the

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Partisan Review.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
This because you're thirty six years old now and I understand that between the war and today you

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
lived a very colorful and varied life. I wonder if you tell us of the sings you

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.000
did

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I don't know if you want to qualify or not but I was asked off as a white hat.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Because about my school wasn't finished and I had to look for some

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
profession and then I learned and.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I worked on the in a mine in and after

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I learned. Cemetery I was stone mason.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The last Greystones for people and then I learned and

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I ask all of this Rudolf and after but some

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Burnell and about one year one and a half year was a dress

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
drama and I think that's all he

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
had time. How did you live through your writing or through these kind

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
of

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Vocations Yes I always did most of Gaza sculpture drawings and

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
writing and how did you support yourself up through

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
the years to my age of twenty six and never sought about.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Publishing something I just did

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
it and then I was married

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and then I saw trust. Perhaps it's

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
possible to publish something and from just time becomes more and more important for

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
me to write something and put some sings together.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
But this can. Change. Also on the next day here.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Start again with a sculpture or another profession I don't

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
know you perhaps best known as a novelist. I wonder where you place

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
the greatest importance and what part of your work as a novelist or the other things that you

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
do I think for me the most important thing is partly the motifs

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
of novels you can see and in my poetry and

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
prose poems to see

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
about everything that's happening in this

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
novel some thing also is a poem and it starts

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
there was at last another form. Social as a

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
sings in writing poems and writing no votes but the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
same question for me. Does this mean that the imagery that you use in your poetry. Appears

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
later in your novels. Yes some part and sings in poetry also

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and in the novice and for me just afterward

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
because some language was you can say destroyed

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
perhaps and that was not only my.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
To rebuild the language and to work with us language also for as a

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000
poet just after as a warm dry many it was the same question and this was it.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Perhaps from forty five to fifty five this

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000
time the most important things happened from Germany and literary life it was in poetry.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
It's not about no one outside of Germany but

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
for ourselves now writing

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
novelists this time was very important. It's a basement

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
of everything happening now one from

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
another the basement is this what has.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Has been this time in poetry. What do you feel it was poetry first and then the

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
novel for poetry you need more discipline and and and.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
As it has a light inside you see it in

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
poetry and the novel. You can you can you can

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
hide it perhaps something else but that. If your book is poetry that's a good discipline

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000
and last was a situation after the war that was.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.000
The

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
question discussing say that the German language had to be rebuilt.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
How do you go about rebuilding a language. Where do you begin.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Now you have to prove all those expressions.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
We had just after the war perhaps and sort of Delphic the language the language of high tech or

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.000
something

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
as full of substantive and German

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
language a very long and very empty and you have

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
to try of this specialists

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
and this was the job I had to do for myself with the

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
language and

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
poetry. To look to the facts and to see

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
what are facts and what are the subjects and but this language.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
You were writing is realistic. And yet it is still with the

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
most fantastic imaginings. And I wonder what you mean when you say your writing is realistic

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
because I'm believing that fantastic things are part of realistic things all

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
this together. That's from your reality fantastic sayings and so

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
yes people call realistic

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
things. Well when you say that both the fantastic and the

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
stocks are real is one more real than the other or are they real in different

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
ways and you see in the ten lines. Sometimes I begin

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
trapped in a so-called realistic

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
way and from one senses as a

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
as changing in a fantastic about the end it's coming back

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and so called When I left that world.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
All this working for me to get as a. To show. The sings

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
I I would like to show I need but

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
was also the siblings. And I bring this

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.000
out and I say more important and Sauza all working together for me.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
The question is to grouse when the fantastical appears in your

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
work is does it appear merely as a

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
symbol. Or an equivalent to something or is

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
it something that you think you might meet some they are around the corner of a street you're walking

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
on is it to be taken almost a collection of symbols that

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000
bows disciplines the fantastic and generous to approving each other.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And if I write in a fantastic

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
way. I always try to make

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000
it serious

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
social facts and to prove this is this

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
is fantastic sings.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
It's a don't fly away.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
How does this fantastic prove the

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
real. And the set in the same in that yes

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
it's in the words and

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
it's if I perhaps I show people like going.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
By by bus

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.000
of the railways just in the right mystical way. And then.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
I show that's only one possibility to show as a same

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
way but also the saying was it was over and attended on

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.000
then people are jumping from the front to Palau.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Yes and that's a picture of a

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
judgement and after those pictures a reality is coming back and proving is

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
this and then I have. The facts are one zero on just how

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
well I need afterwards. Listen I mean

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
with the one side is quite troubling

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
and. Provings the other side

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
you use long lists of technological and almost scientific descriptions

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000
of say the tomb stone carving why in such a labyrinth detail.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
I see for me the picture I have I would like to show and I don't have

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
to try it again and again. Until I have the feeling

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
now that's a picture.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
I would like to show and for all this I need just flag which insists this bear up

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
sings and the shoulder does perhaps coming from from from

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
my sculpture profession to show everything from all

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
sides to show not only in one

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
perspective the sort from from every side and for this and needs

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
is perhaps a monster of words

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and once the lines.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000
What was the inspiration for the idea of after the hero of the.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Well that's a long story seven years before I started to write downs a

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
novel I had tried to write the poem I was just I was

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
in Paris first time it was really a long and bad

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
poem I wrote about. Holy man

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
standing on a quantum. Like an early Christian times.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And but this was and modern times it was wasn't a religion man standing on a

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
quantum amazing build up his column by himself and look here's what it's from

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
this point and described his of of but it was

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
so static for another. And so

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
I shamed just perspective from the column for down under the desk.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
It was not a static point of view it was a moving

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
and could work was as a signature.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
It was one side of the being as I

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
was also years ago I saw. In

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
the family. Yeah. The boy Officer years.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Between But I want a person speaking about something.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And he has a

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
drum and he didn't take care of grown up people he

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
always runs

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
around. And if

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
a grown up person speaks to him he

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
didn't give any sign of interest. He

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
only had has his drama that was astonishing thing for me. And

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
all just again builds up the figures of what's come out so I that's saying sell but

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:38.000
I don't know

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
really you definitely don't intend I imagine these things to be taken

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
as symbols as this effects on me as

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
if. I think it's not possible for

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
me to begin to start writing a book or his services opinion now

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
I want to make somebody saw something that's doing just to have

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
a symbolistic book afterwards but not that novel.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Perhaps the deformity is asking cannot be taken as a fixed symbol but

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
I wonder why after the artist the drummer is deformed and

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
is distracted. So very much of his activity results

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
instructions while he's living in this pain mess and he's If you want a mirror

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:28.000
or office time but. Not them and.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
A normal liver or

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
marrow you see life you see into so perhaps this.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
And this way he's giving back his work. The middle way

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
and in this way he also he is very complex

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000
and

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
what I mean that's all of his time is coming together and

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
has place in his hunchback but it's been said that the grotesque is the

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
symbol of this. Do you feel this is too. I don't

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
understand all of this as this is looking for a symbol

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
of

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
protests things but got to go test the world has nothing to do with symbols.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Perhaps the word symbol there was ill advised but that the girl test is the

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
dominant characteristic about age would you say

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
that yes that's one one part

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
yes one possible test. But it's always changing C.R.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Saltire Yes it's quite another

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000
thing. And.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
There are also some chapters in September.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
The beginning perhaps of self suppose the post office. It's

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
quite another discipline to write a chapter and I'm changing

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000
very often a

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
style from protesters up here until around I stick

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
this description or something out and thence coming back to

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
grotesque and the as over the last chapter also first the concept and

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
one that's the trumpet man.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Sets from farmhouse Rondell so vases. The motives coming

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
back and coming back again that's quite a lot of things and I

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
protest same.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
But there is a great deal of the good test. In the novel. Do you

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
yourself view the world in this way or is this again mirroring in the

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
distorted way the way the world you know I'm not so that's necessary.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
And that's one one way for me to show is

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
this was it was a point of view of the scum I thought

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.000
and that's and you know ws my last novel.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
The story. Person's telling the story and it

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
was sweet. Different more or less protest and

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
and all just three together

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
makes much of a lot of credit miles to the meter but

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
that's my person perhaps but I can say that. That's my point of view to

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
see the.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Use the image that Oscar reflects the world as a concave

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
mirror would reflect the world. Why bother. Why have the mirror

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
distorting the world.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Yes because to write today

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
a novel.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
And for me if it's a question for me to write a novel. I

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
need this things to socialize or.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Can

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
we think why.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Because that was the other sexed up like us God has done

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
that this is that and I can can do it was the sayings and.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
I have to look for my own

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000
forms.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Will it be impossible for an artist today do you think to use an ordinary mirror that

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
is neither convex not concave

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
I never have seen an origin of him or so on more or less common

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
car. Or convex. And for me it's common car for mirrors

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
that something not out of Sirte.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Don't need that I invent him he is he is and I will vote and I

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
only have to use him. That's nothing

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
extraordinary after is a character who seems to

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
be utterly indifferent and not touched by human emotions when his

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
mother dies he's only sorry because she won't take him out anymore to the shop or somewhere.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Do you feel that this indifference is again way into parolees today. Why is

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
he so indifferent.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Every people is like like one stanza sings more or less and and attacked off Oscar.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000
At this perhaps more than another people. But this is the essence of the motives are the

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
same and this more personally I put a lot of not just together as

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
a content trait.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
This things

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
and I don't like just concave mirror ears.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Or skies not nothing exceptionally this is also our world.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
I sing so why do you link ascared with Jesus

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000
after refers to himself as asking Jesus the child of indifference with the child of love.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Yes this is difficult to explain because he is playing

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000
with symbols.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Yes there are no symbols in but he is but because he's in his

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
word and around him all everyone everywhere are symbols as Jesus

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000
and all the things you get from grown up person and his playing was

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000
a sings these Look going to church and you see that all those years of grass and

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000
this edge has his

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
size and his below

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
eyes and the first the first sortie has to change

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
that's why I am not Jesus and. He's always

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000
playing with a sings and then. After he begins us playing and

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
then after some times become serious.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000
He actually says to the statue of the child Jesus he says

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
you bastard I hate you you annoy your hocus pocus this doesn't sound like

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
playing.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Yes After some thought he is thriving until we are yes but the

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
playing a bad way perhaps yes easy is. Struggling with him

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000
taught

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000
us like to buy. Yes.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
The same agent the same size.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000
And he's angry about it because you don't like to make

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
a move to the shoulder wonder something else in my life

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
and none seem to fascinate you both. In your painting and your work

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000
what fascination do they hold for

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
you and I was out yes that's coming from my drawings are black and white as far

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000
as black and white to persons who can make nice drawings.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
It's very difficult to make interview mad it was me because I always try to

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
hide. I mistrust and

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000
wonder what progress your newest novel represents over the ones you've written

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
before I don't believe in progress unless there as I don't see the possibility to

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
make progress you can make it but at some business. I don't believe this to will

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
but in literature I don't see any way to make progress and for

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
me it's every book second or

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
cert trying.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
And the waiters say the same things

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
but because I had the feeling of the last trying it was not

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000
good

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000
enough and and their only concern shows a sings

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000
in another way from the other

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
point.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
And that I can say that's a progress. Say in the hours a sentence

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
about doesn't mean the tenor on Mars that's more fraud or more close.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000
But that's another question that's a progress are not.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000
It's been said that the post one German novelist

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
central focuses on coming to grips with the past of the world wars.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Do you feel that your book is particularly rooted in the German past or does it have

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
an application. It's much broader.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Also German novelist. All different you see and are

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000
coming from from different points and.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Between them this is my my my trying that sets one

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
one point of view and the owners and trying the scenes in another way and

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:25.000
the tool and cupping tool and.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000
Perhaps

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
by novice I was a. Last offers of was a first trying

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
to shoulder and. In

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000
a great depend on Raman the biggest panorama from.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.000
And what I tried again was taught to write on a chronological. Way.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
I cut off phrases.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Yeah look into the yeah. And this is a

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
discipline of radio plays perhaps as montage

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
of the station itself novel of the flashback.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000
I don't work with a station like because I think it's good

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000
for for regular play or something that's. Once in

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
my opinion do what. And that's a reason to have books on law

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
that

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
requires actual yes as

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000
in the past yes I really thought in the beginning of the century and dying slowly

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000
slowly slowly. That the spot difference

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000
between other authors.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000
But I wonder to what degree you feel this convex or concave mirror reflects

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000
Jimminy and is located and rooted in the experience of

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
the World War and to what degree is a much broader reflection of Western

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000
civilization today.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
This I don't know yes I only have as a novel I have to deal with Germany

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000
and pass time in Germany but now I see that as a

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000
people not living in Germany also interested. Concave

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000
mirrors and

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
perhaps at some other lands and.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Perhaps America or France the same question about this I

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000
didn't know

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
before you got you your works are

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000
almost untranslatable it's very difficult to do justice to them in another language.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000
I wonder how you feel about having and translate into other languages and how satisfied

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
you are with the translations from what you could tell.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
As I only saw says it is English in the French

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000
translation.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000
And I sick if it's possible to translate as purposes but both translations are well

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
done and as Bob was both translators asked me

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
questions answered.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000
And that's all what I can do and it's another

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
sign that I'm always astonished that people outside

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000
of Germany and thrust of the spokes and that and never saw this before.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000
And the sad thing I don't have the time

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000
to be so much interested. As translations. I have to write

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000
another book after the slots another

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
book. And just have a

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000
book border in mind my son in but I don't know I'm just translations to

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
present sometimes in the morning I'm looking at

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
that

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000
as a big clue just to me to see a lot of books together. What do you working on

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000
now I'm writing the play for

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000
center does this also begin in the past and work forward and I

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000
was still calling on one day on the seventeenth of you will find that I'm going

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
to fifty three in the news but I'm like

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.000
yes I just. Revolution's

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000
I remember now you don't see

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:08.000
him and certainly that's past time yes that's eleven years ago.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
Back then but I don't perhaps

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000
that's.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000
For interest. Yes today and now we have a national holiday off

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000
this revolution this. I'm happier of

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000
illusion about this tamed if I try

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000
to write a play.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000
Do you feel me suggest that the writer has an important political will to

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
play well as anybody else. Yes

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000
that's the day it sings coming more and

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
more to guys and ginger.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000
If you want or not ever your site has this particular order.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
He's speaking about the war not about a war if somebody is writing poems about

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000
flower sets off of political opinion.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000
I wonder what your opinion is of the German play most recently to come to America

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
deputy Who'd.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000
Or has I have seen some bones as a first performance.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000
And just to sing it as a book of Whole Foods as a full

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000
plate as a documentary part and I think that's an interesting book

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000
all this

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000
together. Because in this book you see not only as a pope you

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000
see lots of the German enters through off group and also sings and the performance

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
and see it there in Germany perhaps a cut off this group

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
sings and there

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000
only was a question of the

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
pope and I prefer as a book in this

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
case but a single it's not possible to show all of this together and one

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000
performance play the play in the book is too

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000
long I wonder is this good to mention the contemporary

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
right or right. Did you admire the most Other than yourself.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000
No I'm you see a lot on my

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000
part of my generation that says we own saliva much

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000
as Bob sometimes to the front of my hands and we're living to present vote on

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000
and speaking about such

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000
things you've been in America for a short visit I would if you have any impressions that you

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000
might like to

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
mention the biggest. As for me that the traffic is

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:35.000
building by car accident. The driver so I slowly and.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000
In Germany it's perhaps.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000
One of his driving to help us very fast and not very often

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000
I just don't know another thing I was very astonished as I saw a lot of people

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000
writing was left

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.000
