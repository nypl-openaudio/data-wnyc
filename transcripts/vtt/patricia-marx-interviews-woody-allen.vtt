00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
My guest today is one of the funniest and most original of the new young comedians in a

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
few years he emerged from behind the scenes as a gag writer to the spotlight as a

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
star performer in the best clubs in the country. His first record has been

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
released in July. He is Mr Woody Allen.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Mr Allen. How did you land still in your twenty's in front of a Mike making people laugh.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Well when you say and still in my twenty's. That seems to be a customary age

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
to begin I would say that I'm a late beginner as a matter of fact most of the comedians that I

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
know were very interested in performing and going to see other comedians.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I've seen as far back as their teens and you know when they're eighteen or nineteen they were

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
already seeing things in the mountains and scuffing around for any kind of work

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
they could get before me I didn't start performing at all till two I guess I'm twenty six at

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
the time so you just knew this couple of years and I've been doing it about two and a half years. You know

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
what with the steps that led up to you being a performer because you weren't planning to be were you when you were younger.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
No I was the furthest thing from my mind. Actually I started writing when I was very

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I want to be a comedy writer and I start writing the piece on his radio show when I was about

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
seventeen in high school in

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Brooklyn and that show led to the herb Shriner television show and

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
that show led to another and pretty soon I was working year after year

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
very consecutively from show to

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
show in television with absolutely no interest in performing I

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
was much too shy to perform and I was interested only in writing a play

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
or something of that nature in the movie maybe and about two and a

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.000
half years

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
ago. It occurred to me that I might want to try out

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
some funny things that occurred to me that wouldn't be right for a play they were too

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
small the ideas were too small for plays and there was no place

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
on television where I could really give them to other comedians and it occurred. We want

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
to just give it a try and see what would happen I couldn't care less if I succeeded I was

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
a dismal failure. Nothing didn't matter to me at

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
all and for the first six months of performing I losed it.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I really hated it because I was working at that

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
time on The Garry Moore Show was writing it making. A

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
tremendous salary writing

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
it and I had to go down in the evenings it was freezing at night and I

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
would do a hard day's work writing and go down in the evenings in the village for no money when I

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
say no money I mean no salary at all not a

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
dollar just they were doing me a favor letting me break in and I get up on the floor of a little club called

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
the duplex I'm going to village and I would try my act to six customers or

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
ten customers that never had any people

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
or and it was a brutal experience that went on that way until I got an

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
act going. How did you get over being shy. I still haven't really gotten over being

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
shy I'm still considerably shy really I

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
was Riddick I was so shy at that time that I was unable to get up on stage for years and

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
finally I got up in the most tentative manner really and I was ready to

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
quit every night it's just a painful

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
experience and then after a while. I found to my amazement that I was

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
getting exceptions from quarters that I respected

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.000
my

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
peers the comedians that I really like very much very

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
encouraging and the newspapers and magazines apparently found something because they gave me a

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
great

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
many good reviews very early and I got into a lot of major

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
magazines my first year

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
performing and I got a lot of television shots so you know I started to go that

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Alb place in the perspective of other comedians we were influenced by

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.000
the group of young comedians of that or just had to be like Mort Sahl Lenny Breau.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Influence to the degree that I find them funny and you know

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
I not really influenced too much when I first

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
started. Well this is about as I said turn half years ago I thought that I leaned a little

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
bit toward Mort because I had tremendous respect for him

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and I guess I even sounded a little like him I didn't work like him or

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
do what he did but the vocal intonation is almost the same

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
because you know I would go and see him all the time and just sit AUSTRAC he was you

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
know skyrocketing to fame at that time and dazzling

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
audiences and. So I was influenced to that degree but that didn't last very long when I first

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
thought of the one criticism in terms of their evasion from

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000
people was that I reminded them slightly of Mort Sahl but I never get that anymore.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
I just gradually drop that as I became more confident.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
You know it's something you throw away the crutch that you're leaning on

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and so it doesn't happen anymore

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Fortunately he does a good deal of political satire and commentary. Are you interested in doing that.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
I'm not interested in doing it that the own people have asked me why do you avoid politics I don't avoid them.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
If something funny occurred to me that was political tomorrow on any political subject that

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000
all I would do it is just that nothing as of yet has occurred to me.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
That would really be worth doing you know that's political How do you get your ideas for jobs

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
what kind of things to manage. I don't know if you know it's a very

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
painful process of discouraging it and it's very hard to say

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
nothing. I couldn't begin to describe the process for you I walk along

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
the street in something funny occurs to me in the most

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
bizarre way I was walking along the street new card to me want to be

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
funny if there was some sort of little animal that was an animal when it walked on

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
four legs and you could certainly pick it up and play it like an accordion and it would make

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
music. Now I can't tell you how that thought originated or why it

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
suddenly hit me with that vivid

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
clarity all of a sudden you know nothing the sequence of thoughts led up to it and I made a little notation

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
on the inside of a match. And I have home. Dozens of matchbooks and little things

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
I've noted jokes labels and napkins and things and

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
I assemble them and you know improvise in my

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
room. Do you work out on a joke in which you get this idea and what do you do with it. Oh

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.000
yes I try

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and actually eventually find a way of saying it where it's

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
really economical and pithy you know I like to be able to say

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000
it

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
fast and most effectively. And while I vary

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
enormously in the general description of stories when it comes

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
to certain punch lines. I say them. I dentical you all the time really the

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000
same beat the same you know if I for instance if out cough.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.000
On a punch

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
line and it aids my timing and I did it

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
once cough. Every time I do that line and that's what America

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
just reflexively you know without putting on the coffee I'll come to that line and

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
my instinct for timing

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
will make me cough and I will and you know the lion will get its usual laugh

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000
assuming that it didn't

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
originally projected you know can you say that over and over again. Does it get by rote I mean do you

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000
lose the you move it

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
yourself I don't lose the you are of it but I but I do find from playing night after night

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
that I find myself up on stage and aimless Tuesday evening or

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
something and I'll be saying

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
my act and I'll notice that I will be going by rote for a minute and

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
then I stop myself and sort of relax and again lapse

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
into relating it in a

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
definite spontaneous conversational

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
manner but occasionally you do. Suddenly start

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
reciting and that's a bad habit to get into You've got to keep

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
alert you base a lot of your jokes on your family or mother or father or

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
grandfather do these people really exist as in any form the way they are Nischelle. Yes.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
I would say I've been asked this constantly everything that I say

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
is very definitely based on truth. I

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
I do naturally have a mother and I did have that kind of relationship and to have

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
that kind of relationship with them exaggerated for comic purposes when I do it in joke form on

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
stage I was held up and robbed in my lobby I was married and divorced I am and it was

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
an analysis.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
I was at the Hollywood California. I do have great difficulty with mechanical objects

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
almost unbearable. I was thrown out of New York

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
University and so all of that is true now of course.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
I exaggerated. You know in relating it to an audience because you know otherwise it would be

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
pretty flat but it's true to that

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
extent I understood that you were thrown out of N.Y.U. and C.C.N.Y. in one year is

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000
that right yes it was this on purpose. How does have they did it on purpose.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
I don't know I was I guess a poor student and I went to New York University I was a motion

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
picture production major there because I can't think of anything else but they never went to class

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
and I never took tests. What textbooks or anything I showed up

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
and they threw me

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
out. You know. Do you regret not having on to some education don't you

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
care you know I really really don't regret it and not at all I

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
if they were out of tune with me completely.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
You know I have no regrets whatsoever it would have been absolute waste of time in

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
certain areas. You see it is. Naturally there are some things for instance I wouldn't trust a doctor

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
who is not formally educated but. For a writer or a

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
comedian the need for formal education or formal education itself is a luxury I mean

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
I you know I read all that I want to and that's all I just I just would have

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:53.000
been of no value to me or such minimal value that to invest for years and it would have been just preposterous.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
What kind of things you like to read.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Will for a few years there I read anything and everything. I

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
was always a great. Philosophy for my wife when I was

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
married was a philosophy major at Hunter College and I got a carious education

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
and philosophy through hardly just anything novels and and history and philosophy

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
and you know anything can lay my hands on and now slowed up my reading a lot in the

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
last two years or so because you know when I was thrown out of college. It was

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
a sensitive point with me because I

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
was an educated of course really

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
and there wouldn't be any education less educated myself so I would

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
just read. Day and night constantly and I read just everything I could lay my hands

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000
on

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
really and that was it and then I admitted to myself after I had read the

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
philosophers and the psychologists in the his star in the novelists and

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:50.000
the

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
poets. That I don't like really you know I just like it that I did it

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
out of a sense of obligation every year or so. Every six months

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
I curl up with a book that I really get an emotional kick out of but it doesn't move me like

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
the theatre does there's just no comparison. What are the things you like

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
most I like some theatre.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
I watch the Marx Brothers old movies and the slander you see feels old

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
movies and Leslie that excites me and a lot of things that Charlie Chaplin

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
did I like all kinds of music all kinds of classical music

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
and all kinds of jazz and. Gee I don't really know I like going

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
to theater a certain amount of the time there's just unfortunate not enough theater

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
around any real

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
value to see I like.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Walt Disney enormously and. Bergman the loneliest monk

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000
I don't know it's hard to say really what I like.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
I have very few. And very little time for recreation anymore.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
How did you change effected your life of being no prominent entertainer is it a change for

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
the better or for the worse in terms. Way spend your time I think

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
it can really be only a change for the better in a sense no I'm

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
not talking economically it is obviously great

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
economically but it's a good emotional change I do find

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
it embarrassing to be recognized.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Genuinely embarrassing so much so that. I very very often don't go

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
into restaurants and I feel self-conscious when I go walking or something

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
because. The more you can television the more you get recognised and it just

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
embarrasses me that's all probably because secretly I have an urge to be recognised enormous

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
you know but it really does bother me

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
and yet still in oil. It is a sign

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
of success to be recognised so you have a mixed feeling about it.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
On the whole although I

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
like succeeding as a comedian there's no doubt about

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
it I guess. Mostly because it opens doors for me I get more offers to write

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
things because of performing I get offers for. Projects that

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000
I never would have been considered eligible

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
for are you thinking of writing in literary form or and for film. Yes and

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
a great many ways I think the writing I wrote a film I was paid to write a film and that came

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
about strictly through performing some people came into the Blue Angel in New

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
York and hired me to write a film and pay me a staggering amount of money I was just

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
absolutely stunned by it and it's a regular Hollywood film which I

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000
wrote for Warren Beatty and

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
myself. It's not the kind of a film that I would choose to write

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
myself but I felt that I ought to do it because one because of the money

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
too because it would get my foot in the door in Hollywood both as a performer and as a writer.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
So I did it purely as an investment to come out and have a come out yet it's going to be filmed in

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Paris shortly. It's called like a new pussycat. And it's a sex farce.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
And as I say it's not the kind of film that I would write myself but you

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
know it's a good enough for a start for an entree. I wouldn't do it again for double

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:01.000
the

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
money because I think if it didn't serve its purpose the first time in getting me

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
and then forget it but it was absolutely a good gamble and I am

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
writing a play for Broadway this fall a

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
comedy and I was asked since I've been performing oddly enough never when I was

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
a writer now than a performer. I've been asked

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
by several publishing companies to write books for them and I've been approached by newspaper

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
syndicate to write once a week syndicated hopefully

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
funny column you know sort of like Robert Benchley years ago that kind of thing that does interest

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
me I think at the time for now but it would interest me after a while I

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.000
think in your acts you often do a parody of a relationship or your wife or with other women.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
What do you think about American women right now in the Senate and

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
mystique women. I found over the years that

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
they're different than men and they have to be evaluated by a completely

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
different set of standards

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
and there are certain aspects of them that's

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
enormously disappointing I find another aspect of them.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:12.000
That's aesthetically super but I'm not talking about just physically Now there's.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
There's an inscrutable.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Real

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
strange quality about them. That's absolutely fabulous in

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
its imperfection. They're not good to rely on they're

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
generally scatterbrain by nature the good ones are scatterbrain

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
and and generally worthless and so I have of course I have a particular

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000
problem because I'm attracted

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
to I want the kind of woman that won't have me. That's the only kind

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
of interest me and I'm generally attracted to a

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
spoiled selfish

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
immature beautiful sadistic women because I will.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Yes because because I just am. That's all. So you're really getting a very biased

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:57.000
view

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
here and I find those women. Totally imperfect but absolutely lovely

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.000
and worth risking all for you know but.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
I'm probably the world's worst person to ask

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
anything about women because my relationships with them are

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
really out of the

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
ordinary I have a psychoanalysis do you find that help coming to grips with

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000
reality

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
particularly. It's some help. Yeah it's it's it's better

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
than nothing it's you know it hasn't been fantastic but it's better than nothing

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
I've been in the house just now about eight years and I've been

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000
going four and five times a

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
week and I think that talking about yourself with

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
some objective person an hour a day five days a week for

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
years would be of some help regardless I mean just to take the time most people don't take the

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
time in their life ever to sit down and really try and make connections between their thoughts so just on a

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000
purely non-medical level it is of some value automatically and with of course

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:01.000
a trainee

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
analyst it naturally is of much greater value

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
but it. I found it. I don't know to be honest. Maybe a little disappointing I

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
had hoped that I would come out of analysis as absolute

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000
swordsman and spoiler of women and you know great uninhibited

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
with the type where the Western world and.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
I haven't. And there's nothing I can do about it because I make no

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
promises when you get home. Don't know says if you for five days a week eight eight years

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
nobody is interested in you for an hour a

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000
day you know is the point is he's not interested in hearing the whole idea of analysis.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
No you know nothing that I

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
was free to leave at any time and certainly could leave it any time

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
and I know it's in no sense or wasn't for me in any sense.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Habit forming at all I just hoped that it would you know work

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000
out and it was of some value

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000
definitely who's to say where I could've been a performer or not. If it weren't

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000
for now just now I might have just simply done the exact same thing if I wasn't masses.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
I might not have but we'll never know

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
so well there's none of these things enter into your activity and analysts

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000
or all the reading you've done this last thing in it's very direct personal

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
experience they do enter into my act

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
but not in the any sense because

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000
I'm against that definitely I'm against what I want my activity I would like to

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
do as a stand up so-called stand up comedian one who talks to an audience.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000
I would like to get into my act to sing surrealistic insanity as the Marx

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Brothers did in their movies in ratio. You know because I'm working in a different

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000
media now facing an audience and talking to them the Marx brothers ran amok and a movie set

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:47.000
was a different

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000
thing but as far as those things entering in they do enter in because I

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
do talk about analysis a great deal and to

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
approach certain subjects with I would say the stereotyped Freudian

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
conception of things and I

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
do jokes on philosophy I don't. For instance do

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
or piece of comedy material that's steeped in you

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
know existential thought that's not consciously you know you could bring that

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
to it. I mean to anybody if you wanted to but I mean I never would attempt anything like that

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
because it would bore me

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000
stiff. Are there any things. What is it you like to criticize in American society we get so

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
many positive back and former the materialism you think about things

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000
like this. Well I'm pro conformity and pro materialism think

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000
those things. Generally interest me I want wealth. And

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000
accumulation of

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000
goods and all things like that you know there's I think good and

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
healthy and you know I I like that and I also like.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
I don't. Well I can't say that I like to conform I like to do what I want to do really you

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
know but.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
I don't want any big piece. Will stopping there you know if I like to give them anything that

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
they want or play their game. I'm not a. Like a courageous I don't

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
make citizen's arrests or anything like that. You know I like to play it fairly

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
safe with the rebels. No I can't do that I would be a rebel in any sense of

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
the word I just really want to be left alone to do exactly what I want when

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
I want to do it and I want as much of what I

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:31.000
want immediately when I want to you know I believe that.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000
That's a desired goal is. If I have any impulse at all and I want to gratified.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Ideally I would like it gratified as quickly as possible and in as great an abundance.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000
As I can wish for material things anything at all and in whatever it is that

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
I want I want immediately and I want plenty of it. Do you get it.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
No not all the time. Certainly not. And you know and it's unfortunate but I I

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
and when I don't get it I get frustrated and

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
angry and upset but I would like

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000
to what do you think you want to go from here. What are you doing. Your next of X. and I'm Which long are you

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
satisfied with this. I'll tell

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000
you I always wanted to really do is much as I could as long as it

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
was comedy in any area. I do like the idea of writing essays writing

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
funny short stories writing movies directing movies directing Broadway writing for Broadway writing for

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
television appearing on television directing on television you know as long as it is

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
somebody all those kind of projects interest me. The only things that don't interest

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000
me are projects of a more serious nature when I say serious that's a bad

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
word more dramatic nature. I don't want to get involved in anything

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000
that isn't funny because I'm not good at it and then I'm not good at

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000
something I flounder around and that causes a lot of unhappiness. So

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:51.000
and also I don't want

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000
to say anything in my work but securely. I'm not

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
looking in any way at all. To make any.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Statement or any sort of pedantic or even month a day and take

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
message of any sort I just want to make the people laugh for the time

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
that they're at the play that I write or watching my act and that's all

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
I'm not interested in if

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000
there happens to be. A message in there

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
fine but you

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
know it really doesn't interest me very

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000
much you know series of why there's such inordinate reporter between you and the audience.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
No I don't think one ever really knows what it is that the

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
audience is getting out of him when he performs it was always a mystery to

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
me why anyone like me I don't mean that self-effacing me.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000
I

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
mean you know I knew I was telling good jokes and I know that I was able to deliver them decently I

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000
wasn't stuttering and stammering I knew to face the audience

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000
but I didn't anticipate that there would

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
be a particular report I didn't think that I would be chosen out

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000
of fifty comedians say to to advance beyond

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000
the other forty nine. I mean that you know I'm giving

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000
a hypothetical thing here. So I don't really know I walked out on stage

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
and and get ready to do my act and I guess it's occurred to me at times that I

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
don't present any threat to

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
them that they you know

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000
that what's not to like about me you know I mean I'm I mean I'm obviously not

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000
going to hurt them in any way and I think I'm not going to take their women and

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000
I'm not going to steal their money or involve any of them

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
in intellectual discourse that's beyond them or anything I'm just gonna come out and tell

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000
a couple of

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000
jokes and I don't dress better than they do and I don't do this deliberately mind you

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000
but apparently they don't find anything in me that they

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000
feel competition with I'm guess I'm I'm no contest to them so it's

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
a joke and even then incidentally if the jokes aren't funny.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
We had like to close with an excerpt from your new record modestly entitled.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Woody Allen not so modest when you see the picture and I want to thank you very much for this interview.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000
Thank you.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000
I went to N.Y.U. myself I would say. A solo major that.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000
I took all the

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000
abstract philosophy courses in college like truth and beauty and its vast

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000
truth and its immediate true. Introduction

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000
to go to death. One o one in

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
the

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
post not a big way my freshman year. I cheated on my metaphysics finals. Alison I

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
looked within the soul of the boy sitting next to

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000
me

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000
and my mother who is a really sensitive one and when I started college she locked herself in

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000
the bathroom took an overdose of March on

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
time

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000
and I was analysis should I know that. I was in group analysis when I

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000
was younger so I could afford private. I

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000
was kept in the late. Paranoid

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:10.000
softball

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000
team to play old in the Roddick's on Sunday

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
one male bias against the bad

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:28.000
weather

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000
and if you don't seem to write explain stuff on it's really funny feels like I'm

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
very I'm feeling guilty and go

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
back

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000
the

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
you. Also I have a cousin that my parents made that really strike

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
me as a boy because I went from four years of college and became a

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
mutual fund salesman and he married a VERY SOON girl from the neighborhood her know

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
was lifted by a golf pro. Hit.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
Hooked up overhead.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000
They moved to the suburbs unable kinds of status symbols of their own home

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
and station wagon and fire insurance

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000
and. Life insurance and mutual funds

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000
and I don't know what else to tell you about myself. I was a writer

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000
and an actor the television idea was not an act it was an

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
acting class we did a play in acting class by Paddy Chayefsky called getting

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000
in and I play the part of God and getting in.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000
Was typecasting.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.000
Nose method acting so two weeks before I started to live the part off stage. I

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000
really came and got the blue suit. It took

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000
taxi cabs all over New

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:54.000
York. It took big.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000
To

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000
get into a fight with a guy and I forgave

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
him

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:12.000
to some guy hit my fender and I said on to him.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000
I

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
said Be fruitful and multiply.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
But not in those words.
