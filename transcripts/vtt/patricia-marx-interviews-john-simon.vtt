00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The pre-show marks interviews each week at this time your city station brings you an interview

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
with a leading figure in the arts politics or the sciences and here now to

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
introduce today's program is Patricia

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
marks film is the most popular art form of the day my guest is one of its

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
most distinguished in the battle critics. Mr John Simon Mr

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Simon a film critic for the new leader drama critic for the Hudson your view and common

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
weale and author of the recent book of collected film criticism

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
entitled private screenings views of the cinema of the

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
sixty's which just I mean you're a critic of theater novels poetry

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and sometimes art as well as films do you feel that film is the most vital

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
art form of the day.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Well I do think that because there seems to be a

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
great market for film because a whole new generation

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
of young and young middle age

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
consumers has grown up on film. Having film for

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
their very favorite and. Domestic as it were

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
art form the demand

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
has forced a lot of good talent to go into

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
filmmaking and a good many

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
people a few decades ago might have been perfectly happy to be

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
poets or novelists or actors or play it and so

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
why not have all now converged on film.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Which has come to look as a kind

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
of banner art form of the age

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
that kind of form that's flashed in fount of

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
the greatest number of faces presumably leading us on to

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
greater condition. And the it can be so then yes that film is

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
the central line for another. Most popular the most

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
meaningful to the largest number of

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
young people you see the film gets the criticism it deserves.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
No it doesn't and films this isn't may conceivably

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
look easier or more difficult but at any rate different from other kinds

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
of criticism precisely because of the kind of people who practice it

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
either then the very nature of the discipline.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
By which I mean that because so many

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
cranks on the one hand. And so many fanatical

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
are technological enthusiasts on film rights about

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
film film criticism tends to look on the one hand if it's being

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
written by these bohemian types as being easier and less

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.000
would be

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
more foolish than it actually is or if it's written by

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
these experts on the technological side. It made them

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
look at something

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
more cryptic arcane

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
difficult puzzling. But at the same time lest they warding then other kinds of because this

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
is just I mean and how is. Prominently featured from your

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
book and I could hear the first and last responsibility of the critic is to raise the

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
standard of motion pictures as a high brow critic that writes for

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
a magazine that doesn't reach too wide an audience.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
How do you feel you will raise the standard of motion

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
pictures. Well it may be

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
an idealistic view but then again I don't care for any viewer that is

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
not idealistic.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
I feel that so many of the people practicing reviewing or

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
criticism do it either in the spirit of supplying their readers their

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
newspapers with a commodity there has to be a film column it has to be filled with

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
eight hundred or nine hundred words.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
In which case they have to be.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Client cynical and indifferent or even just plain simple minded

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and discriminating or the other types

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
who write films this isn't out of some kind of

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
elaborate personal love hate or love or hate

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
they may have for the movies which leads them into some kind

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
of fantastic cation and and.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Spinning

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
of fancy doing the moves on paper but there are very few people

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
to whom. Films are extremely important extremely serious. Genuine though

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
and for who want the best and nothing but the best from it and I feel this

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
is the responsibility of any serious going to now

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
if his magazine does not reach many many leaders. Nevertheless if

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
he makes an impact on a certain number they can pass the word on

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
to

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
others copies of magazines can be biodata even passed around

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
in some cases.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
If the articles are important enough they can be reprinted elsewhere they can come out

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.000
in book

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
form and eventually are the words of a serious because they will reach

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
a sufficient number of people but even if it doesn't he has to write with that

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
in mind and the end is that films have to become

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
better especially in Hollywood much too commercial

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000
sloppy

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
girlz vulgar brainless self-indulgent.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
But they are that way in other countries to the critic

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
has to fight this tooth and nail and let the chips fall where they may if they don't

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
fall anywhere that matters he must still try to send them there.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
I wonder why you say this I accept the charge of being unfashionable with

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
satisfaction and. Even I confess

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
pride was this.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Well because in. Most art forms but especially in

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
art forms like film which. Appeal to

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
very widely diversified group of

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.000
people enclaves are coteries clique's.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Are formed which push a certain filmmaker a certain type

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
of filmmaking they'll be the camp group will like can

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
be underground films that will be

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
the young beatnik hippie type so will love the sort of

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
irresponsible films of original Luke God

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Are there will be. Perhaps starchy

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
old timers who will perhaps like some old fashioned Hollywood

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
pictures and so on but there are definitely in in

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
film fashions and these fashions.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
I think are the contrary of criticism they're the enemy of genuine intelligent criticism

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000
because

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
they accept something that is motivation

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
in instead of something that is really good and

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
deserving and there are certain fashions that are clearly operating

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
now which I think are particularly if the fare such as the

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
God are. Vulgar which I am a opposed to very happy and proud to

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
be opposed

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
to you call God are the quintessential N.T. artist.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Why are you so violently against Gadhafi. Well.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
This is something that's very hard to explain in a few words it is the

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
longest section of my book and even at that I think it may not be long

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
enough and it may still not explain the sinister in this

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
of this manifestation and plea enough for convincing

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
enough people to

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
perceive but. Briefly go does a man with talent

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
but with a minor. And the major Africans

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
and his kind of filmmaking consists of slapping things together is

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
a is a kind

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
of spoiled in the oldest child font on the Bill of filmmaking

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
who has been indulged and cosseted by the coteries. Whose idea

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000
of filmmaking

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
is total improvisation total

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000
freedom

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
total aimlessness except

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
indulging the whim of that morning's shooting I mean on Monday doesn't know what he'll do on Tuesday

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
on Tuesday he does whatever comes into his head when he sits down beside the camera.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And so on and I'm afraid this is the same mentality which is

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000
responsible today for

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
happenings for pop art

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
for some kind of gross experimentation

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
in music with

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
with hideous sound and even more meaningless

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
silences other than actual mellow they or even anything resembling

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
melody and this this to me is anti art in that it tries to

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
substitute accident improve his

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
ation happening falling into

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
something for an activity. Namely art which to me

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000
has to be carefully thought out.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Systematically planned

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
deeply felt and ex

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000
carjack

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
dated but which of course also showed you those times happy

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
accidents Felicity's that one stumbles upon but which should not base itself

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
on accidents and supposes

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Felicity but at the same time the daughter seems to

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
speak very eloquently to the young certainly of.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Much admired by the younger generation many and generation. Could this

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
perhaps just be a generation gap. You being over these magical age of

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
thirty. Yes I'm even though over the unmagical age of

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
forty but the fact remains that no artist

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
has ever been a major artist if it only addressed himself to

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
a certain age group.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
I don't care how popular novelist was with the five year olds. Even

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
the twelve year olds. He did not on that basis become

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000
post or Joyce or Dickens or told stories.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
To address oneself to people between the ages of fifteen and thirty let

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
us say and to be enormously popular with them particularly when this group

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
today seems to be much more fifteen then thirty and

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000
it's thinking and doing is not. I

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000
think it got N.T. or even the sound indication of ones to stick supremacy.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Perhaps he's capturing or portraying something that is very much a part of the times.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Well in order to capture and portray something in a way to make a

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
truly artistic and truly meaningful for anyone but the group. It has

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
to penetrate into

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
the consciousness and the understanding. And the

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
sympathy of other groups as well a novel about the

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
cellar knees. That would be meaningless outside of Salaam would

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000
not be a good

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
novel. A play and that would be

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000
absolutely

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
irresistible to high school students but only to

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
high school students would not be a great player to appeal only

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
to a generation is not

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.000
enough exaggerating them because he feels more than generations just. To.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Pauline Kael Andrew Sarris but he is a cult among generation.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Well you see this is probably one of the minor tragedies of our culture

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
or civilization if we can honor them with that those terms

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
that the young the the charming brother sensually

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
family ever sponsible young have taken over the culture

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
industry to a very large extent and to the extent that they haven't taken it over all the

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
people who want to appeal to this group as a

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
chief consuming group have taken

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
over and that everything is now slanted in this American society which has

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
always been fanatical about the youth. Anyway. Even before that

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
today's various youth movements are you as being a an

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
absolute mono mania the American consciousness so.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
With this emphasis on youth a lot of older people like Pauline Kael

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
like Angela says for various reasons ranging

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:10.000
from nostalgia to put the most benevolent interpretation on it to.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Hysteria to put a less benevolent interpretation on it will embrace

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
these criteria and this worship of youth

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
but this does not mean that the average

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
responsible person of forty or thirty eight or forty five would be convinced

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:28.000
by

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
them in private screenings you have a chapter called favorites and

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000
you list eleven

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
favorites including an early Sliney an early and Tonio name

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Bergman you know most of these all of these are fairly old films none of

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
them less than five years old do you feel that the most recent films

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
being made in the last five years or less good than have been that the good old days

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
are better than current

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
cinema no masterpieces of course don't come along every.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
And sometimes they come in clusters in fact very often they come in clusters for reasons that too

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000
complicated to go into. However. In the last few years

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
I've seen some most deserving films a few of which I can

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:15.000
name for

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
you which are your favorites from the last five

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
years without calling all of these absolute favorites. I will call

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.000
them all deserving films. Some of them more so than others for the example.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Lawrence of Abia Sundays and

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
magnificent film as is all means other work. The fiances.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
To some extent had the fire within by

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000

Polanski to a lesser extent marriage Italian style nothing

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:02.000
but a

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000
man the collector one of the few American or at least

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
partly American films on the list. The fascist also known as El for

extent the hill. Dear Joan.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
To a considerable extent Alfie to a slight extent perhaps

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
a Man for All Seasons and a few others of which I'm probably not thinking at the

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
moment. In your book you seem not to like most of the recent

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
for the Me and Tony on a I didn't have to get to the spirits

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
and read desert who are the younger or lesser known directors.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Did

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
you Meyer Are there any people that you see. Will gain

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000
the stature of an

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
interview is sure that both the only

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
and Fellini have undergone a falling off since

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
their masterpieces leave it alone the and love into that on the other

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
hand Bergman the whole affair seem to be quite dormant

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
and less than spectacular in the

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
last five or six films came spectacularly to the

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
fore with personal note which is one of the most profound and searching in

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
the same time beautiful films of all time and it certainly belongs

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
on any list of the twenty or thirty best films and I

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
mean. Similarly there are

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
younger filmmakers who promise

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
well twenty four we started

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
out and has more the Simply

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
them quite poorly but a man like that could buy

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Happy change of pace achieve something quite

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.000
marvelous yet on me.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
O'Neill made the absolutely first rate sound of trumpets and

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
only slightly less spectacular The fiance is good yet

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
do very great things not that those who

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
aren't. There

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
are one or two young

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Swedish filmmakers who look very promising Polanski was started

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
out with really smashing knife in the water and there's been wasting his time

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000
on cheap horror movies may yet grow up and

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
into something very good. There are checks

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
who come is to be quite outstanding and the checks have

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
already

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
made three or four very fine movies since the last war most of which haven't

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
been seen here except in special festivals the ones that have. Been seen

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000
actually are not the best films with the exception of closely watched

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
trains with movie of absolutely the first

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
thing so and again jello Pantech all of the it

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000
was documentary The Battle of Algiers a film of major importance.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Peter Watkins with the very fine war game despite

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
the unsuccessful privilege quite yet to do some

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
important film so I don't think the picture is bleak at

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
all you actually haven't mentioned any American directors assess by oversight

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000
or by.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
No not that oversight it's just the only American director for whom one

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
really rooted over the last ten or twelve years was Stanley

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Kubrick and I'm afraid despite Dr say in July which was a

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000
very very worthy and very witty film

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
and important one nothing else that cool

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
because lately as been up to what one

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
expected the other filmmakers in this country are either working within the

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
crippling Hollywood say jacket where they have no

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:12.000
independence

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
really or are too independent by which I mean

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000
they're underground or scattered on impoverished unsupported.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000
Unfortunately neither the foundations nor the state government has

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
any program as yet functioning

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
that adequately finances in the pendent filmmaking which indeed is very

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
expensive but there are stirrings in the

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:43.000
air which indicate that this may change for the better.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:49.000
What about Arthur Penn and his recent film Money implied which is received a great deal of praise.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000
But I think I said Penn is a clever but they're effective filmic

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
I think Bonnie and Clyde is vastly overestimate its

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
technique though. Neat and sometimes quite effective

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
is terribly reminiscent

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
of playful and God. And

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000
other novella Wagner

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
filmmakers. There is there is ultimately a lack

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
of independent imagination in the loss of a lack of first

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000
aid creativity in them which I think prevents him from being

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000
a major film. Because I think always

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000
will one of the recent developments in film which is prominently featured Expo

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000
sixty seven has been new techniques many screen

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
simultaneous action new forms shapes sizes of screens do you feel this

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
is helpful and promising in artistic

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000
terms you know one can always tell the middle dark civic by the fact that

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000
he leaps into prophecy.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
It seems that he is bored with criticism that he likes nothing better than to put a

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
gnostic case about the future and they will tell you at great length that these

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000
new media evolution eyes are film or inversely that

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
they cannot contribute to storytelling and will never have any role

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
in a feature

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
length story films. Thankfully I don't know what the future

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000
holds while I care in the sense that any consumer and

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
then the critic must care. I don't do really care about it that Munch that I

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
should that i should the

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
deflect any great extent of my speculative energies on that other

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000
than on judging evaluating weighing

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
discussing feelings through and thinking through the current films

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
which isn't work enough for anyone who takes criticism seriously I don't know

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000
either there are parts in me which think that these new devices are very

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
interesting parts of me which think that

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000
I cannot as yet for the life of me see how they can be put to

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000
the service.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000
Film art in the sense that I understand and long.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
For that.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000
So I frankly don't know but it's it's it's an ignorance which I think is a quite blissful

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000
and disturbing one.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
I'd like to close the interview with you reading part of a review that in

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
your current book private screening. Would you do

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000
that possibly the one memorable sentence

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
in life double issue on the movie is read. When the

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
day puckers up Senegalese and Swedes feel the touch of

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000
her

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
lips. As I am neither Senegalese nor Swedish The only thing

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
I feel and I stay Packer's up and we shall soon see

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
America's sweetheart without her cloak of and without her

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000
pocket is not. Against my better judgment. I

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000
again attempted the stomach of one of her films. Move over darling which yet again.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000
Affected me as a cross between an old a

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000
sucker and the hand painted necktie. It should give us

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000
pause that diverse day has been for years the number one box

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
office attraction in the American cinema.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:22.000
It should start us thinking that her sickening films have been well received by the reviewers.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
It should make us sit up at the reputable critic on the recent T.V. show

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000
after knocking some of her films hastily added but this was not meant

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.000
to minimize her very real talent. The only very real talent

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000
Miss de possesses is that of

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
being absolutely sanitary personality and touched

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
by human emotions that our UN clouded by human

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.000
thought her form and smudged by the slightest

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000
evidence of femininity. What then does it mean that

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.000
this heavily sugarcoated as well as sugar. Skinned and

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:01.000
sugar

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
boned pill should coax the largest number of

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000
coins from the hands of American moviegoers. From the

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000
tiny sweaty ones of our young. To the daintily

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000
manicured or a vet I'll leave her suit ones about

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000
adults only by the conjoined spending of all these

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:29.000
hands is one anointed America's number one box office attraction.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000
Now the alleged virtues of Miss days Persona

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000
three crisp with girlish radiance

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
and healthy sexuality. As anyone who scrutinizes even one of the

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000
day movies will know the wit is so crisp that duct on

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000
your head. It produces instant coma. The Radiance is

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000
so girlish that it has to be shot through special screens that this guy's a

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
bad case of creeping. Which has begun to average

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000
that once you fully incipit the

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000
face. And the healthy sexuality is a core a protracted game

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
of teases and the blunt on Them's. Played between husbands and

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000
wives or couples. Well on the way to the altar.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000
And with all be and beds remaining relapse

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
area and really solid. What I repeat does

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000
this and then make their worship me. It means that. Two or three

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000
generations of Americans are. Basking in with listeners and calling it with it.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
In the facelessness and calling it

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
radiance in sexlessness and calling it sex in total

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000
darkness and calling it there. It means that until

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000
this sponge sugar zombie melts for the

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
screen there is little chance of the American films coming of age. Whatever.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
Delicious shivers make course up and down the spines of

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Senegal sweet.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000
Mr Simon thank you. My guest has been John Simon film critic for the

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000
new leader and author of the recent book private screening. Thank

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000
you and goodbye for

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
now you have been listening to Patricia Marx interviews join us again

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.000
next Friday at five when once again we bring you the pre-show marks

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:37.000
interviews

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000
that

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:47.000
is

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000
who think that it

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
was you who

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000
think

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000
that

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
if you're.
