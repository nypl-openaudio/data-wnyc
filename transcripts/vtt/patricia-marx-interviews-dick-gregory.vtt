The Negro Problem in America has developed into a crisis whites against Negro and now

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Negroes against Negroes those who stand for nonviolence against those who want blood.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
to nonviolence.

He's my guest today here to tell us

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
about the Negro Problem. It's a white

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So we can have a

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
problem we have people that say what about the Negro crime rate. What were the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
white man's crime rate look like if the negroes took over America tonight and

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Are you saying then the negro superiors in the

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
White know I'm listening all superior to the white model. I'm saying that

America has because he will be outnumbered

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
ninety to one the same way we are and he should look and look at

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
No know any other way because

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I didn't say that some was wrong with him I said maybe it's my big lip and I grew a much station if you

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
look at a lot of negroes you see a lot of negro wear my

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
men roll in a growth process they had their I straighten my hair out and a hundred

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
year period I went from the bottom of my ski to the top of my head nasty of didn't get it I don't have anything

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
else I could do that's why I'm out here on the street today.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I tried I tried I tried everything

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
me everything I could and he wouldn't let

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
me and the constitution today the reason the negro have resorted to

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
violence because we're not trying to take over a country trying to make a constitution work in

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
practice you don't think that the whites will accept the negroes unless they seem like or will

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
they ever

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
accept all of this is everything else what they say to say we too

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.000
loud and the history of the world the man has been pushed down and had to be allowed to be heard.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
So they say I'm too loud sure too loud I got to be over dressed over coffee

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
When I walk down the street I'm a nigger if I drive down in a Cadillac they look around who is

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000

Never in the history of baseball have they ever cancel a game at them o'clock in the morning because of rain like they

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000

Check the department. Doughton find out how many people income in the shop check to the promised of how

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
million sixty thousand

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
show that paid the new head four hundred and forty

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
thousand times to their families money they lost stolen was very effective.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
It was listen what about violence they could be nearing and that's an outburst of

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
violence Francis in Harlem.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Well I don't know everybody talks about violence today. You see the funny thing

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
the white man but a lynching us for hundred years no wipers never talked about violence. We NEVER been

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
able to ever interview show we have no by never talk about violence is a funny thing.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
December the seventh one nine hundred forty

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
one the Japanese was a yellow man to white

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
folks the symbol the

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
A he was a white man he'd been a white man ever since

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
his some

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
of this American white man that and do you let him know

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
you can put this pistol in his head and blow all his brains out.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
You're a nigger. That's why the Africans becoming more white than a Negro.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
That's why Malcolm X. who said the pink eyed devil need to be dead. Martin Luther King's I love your

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
brother turn the other cheek.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
They call Martin Luther King a nigger and a

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:38.000
common years they never call Malcolm X. a communist not a nigger. They've always called him our commands.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
This is the problem in this country is the

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
white man. What do we have to do to move him.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
What do we have to do we tried everything we can try

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
nonviolently and we get laughed that laughed at it and it's funny.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
We had white people talking more about a stoney and then they talked about the six colors.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Has a got killed in

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Birmingham where Stone is nonviolent business stone and nonviolent The sixty years

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
ago killer was violent and they didn't talk about those six kids they talked more about

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
a Stalin and about the Church of God blow them

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Birmingham. But you're just saying that what makes people talk and listen is

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
violence now and violence when it's against

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
white nonviolence. One is the one is against

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
white yourself I'm saying what I'm saying is this here. The violence of the kids was against

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
us nonviolence was against

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.000
white they talk about more nonviolence as against them than the violence does against us.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:44.000
I had a negro assassinated President Kennedy we had to fight white folks in the street.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
That's what I'm saying you say it's OK for violence but when I think

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000
about

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
it and in a shape form or fashion. Everybody gets upset

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
when I volunteer

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
violence the Negro in this country

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
today keeps race riots

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
out of the only way you will get a race rise when I had a white man back a

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
white man hit me four hundred years.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
So here and then to do

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
it where do you stand when you advocate nonviolence and yet you say violence is the only thing that will make

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000
the whites

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
react and I didn't say rounds of do nothing make the whites we act I think is the only thing they've been reacting

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
to we're going to try to do it not bomb committed to

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
nonviolence violence a white man could make me get bomb

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
and then it becomes better than

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000
me nonviolence mean I've found some work done for.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000
What makes you believe the white man will change

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
them and what makes me believe you. I have faith in me not him.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
I have faith that through my demonstrations that he's on the TADA weapon

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
me he can work both

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
ways either I'm a good tired of demonstrating a start you'd know you can get Clodagh within

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
me and I just believe he's going to get tired of weapon

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
me didn't Berman a family get tired of standing hard. Pictures

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.000
come

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
through and you get real upset you see had I taken a gun down the Birmingham to

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
try to get Bull Connor's job O'Connell Steelman work

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
and I got his job without a gun.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Because white people in America. Basically they

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
decent basically ladies in D.C. is a funny thing about a

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
white man in America he has a conscience and he never qualified to own slaves but he tried

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
to own slaves because he was trying to imitate the people he had just

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
left but he realized what a generalized American negro slave of the worst slave

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
in the whole world because I had amassed that couldn't even

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
respect because look check the records and see what type what type of guy came over he went to

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
prison but he had a conscience.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Then all at once he said that I was inferior to

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
him and his conscience had made him block me had made him

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
sit her toes up and every time I'd jump will want her to put another one up me give tell Mr

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
I'm inferior to him I'm inferior to him and not only do we tell the staff I'm in fear him he

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000
tries to make me in period of him. That's why he gives me inferior schools.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
That's why he stands me to the worst things in the world that's why I keep talking

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
about my crime rate and a negroid never shot a polyp in the back. While the plane was

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
gone and I never put four sticks of dynamite in his mother's luggage and blew up a

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
plane negroid know what committed atrocities a white man have in

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
his college but you gotta keep telling the step bout my crime rate. So he can justify what he's doing to

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
me because the day he quit justifying what he's doing to me he'll go crazy.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Well how do you justify the crime rate crime rate is higher among Negroes

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
in my primary disarmingly goes and I tell you

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
what you have many negroes in the south and you do not know if you know that don't

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
you have you ever heard a Southern senators talk about a Negro crime

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
rate. All

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
right now why is it in the south the negro have got a crime rate and up now

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
if you

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
have tell you what. Let's take

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000
New York for

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
instance you have male white friends that you know right right.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Very intelligent. Do you know any male white friend that would give John a New York Police Department.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
You know because there's too many opportunities right.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
OK So then a Negro with a master's degree will get a New York Police

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Department because if I finish college an account number are going to take their opinion work

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
into account inspection but I've got a wife and a family so I get on police department.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
But now I have no intelligent whiteboards knowledge on the police department from the ground level only from the top

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
level and who you don't feel the jobs with just go hire so many a

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
me of killing white

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000
boys that white borders not Barry

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
educated many times is not a police department consists of

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000
a lot of Southern

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
whites and you got a stud and white boy didn't like me in Mississippi and he up here

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
in New York with a badge and a girl and was my crime rate falls look

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
like it was the last time you picked up the paper and read about a Negro stick in a

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
bank in less time you picked up paper and read about a Negro embezzle

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
in Manila time you picked up a paper and read were a negro neighborhood

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
a little four year old girl was raped and chopped up and put in a

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
sewer my crime rate. But what you do

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
you count me if you count the people I get

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
arrested the whites would have the crime rate but you can't the one to get

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000
prosecutors I have mean that a

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
lawyer is that a percentage nonetheless there is a higher percentage of crime rate among the negroes I

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
got there only ten percent niggers in the pot limit ten percent population.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
If you count the amount of people I get arrested. How the do this time out

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
how many police station they have a new

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
yard and you'll find out there. Eighty percent of all the police station in New

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
York the Negroes never been

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
in and who are they bringing in I'm white but they when they go to

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000
trial they come in I'm a

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
lawyer I haven't got one. So I get. Convicted.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
So you can't your crime rate a mom who gets convicted not amount to little gets

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
caught so out all the gangsters in New York. You have heard of a colored gangster.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
But you talk about my crime

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
rate a negro didn't kill that gangster in the Barbershop.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
When Pentland dope we get caught with the dope in Harlem. But if the cops was that

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000
smart they would stop the dope in Manhattan for the white folks cut it and send it to is not

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
New York's a free city

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
job opportunities OK never seen a fire

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
truck there was even talking ladder you ever see a negro driving a five.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Why this degree who are the real Negro leaders.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Well it's very difficult to say who's a Jewish leader in America who's the Irish leader

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
in America who's a tell you to lead America who's the white leader in America.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Then why are we the only groups that have leaders and their leaders were any good for you we wouldn't have known either.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
So maybe you are the only group that needs it in the Irish and the Jews

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000
are simply knowing the full state that the white man. Not only America but the world over.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000
He's losing all over the

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
world and everyone for his Marshall Plan and his money he would have learned a long time ago

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
you see when you bend over to conquer you have to stay bent over to

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
keep and. You have no

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
leaders and want to produce a leader he's not a white

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
leader when you say Who are the four most people in the world today he might be

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
an Irish guy but when I use are easily to you can

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
say when I say who is the Irish president for assassination of Kennedy.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
You couldn't say when I say who the American president uses that community. You

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:47.000
see leaders with us is limited to Negroes leaders to white are not limited to any minority.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
That's why nobody can answer you who the leader of a minority

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
groups we have tremendous

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
leaders that are world leaders but they have been

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
limited and if I told

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
you who the number one. Need role in the country world few people would

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
know Lutie Dr Benjamin May

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
is president of Morehouse University. The young man the late President

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Kennedy sent

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
to the Pope soon to represent him to Benjamin

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
may but we only know Negro leaders as the white power structure you want to

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
know was was to know them the negro to say go slow the only

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Negro leaders as recognized by white folks in the Negro fight in the civil rights bill are great doctors you don't

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
know his name. Our great research is his name is not known.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
All we know is the man a fighting for civil rights and the only one will say as a leader is the negro to say

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Go Slow Love your fellow man.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
We'll have a man like Malcolm X. is he a

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
leader Malcolm X. has become a leader Malcolm X. had probably become the number one leader

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000
in America today the number one group in America today because white people

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000
and colored people know who he is the richest white man old Malcolm X. There's the

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
poets white man know who Malcolm X. did and what he looked

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
like the riches Negro know what Malcolm X. Here's the powers Negro know what Malcolm X.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
is now the so-called Negro leaders who the right man said in there. There's plenty

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
poor poor white people that don't know what the president of the end of lazy people look

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
like there are many many poor negroes who don't know where I work and look

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
like poor negroes and poor white and rich negroes and Rich White know what Malcolm

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000
X. look

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
like so that makes Malcolm X. number one man country

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
today. May be known as a respected.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
He's respected the white man respects him because you never called him a nigger are common in these

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
call Malcolm X. He's called Martin Luther King

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
both the negro respects we didn't want to respect him but we had to

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000
respect

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
him because Martin Luther King said turn the other cheek love your brother they

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
care Martin Luther King in jail and Malcolm X. couldn't get

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
arrested but now do you stand for nonviolence respect Connex

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000
essential

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
violence Malcolm X. do not stand for violence you know what Malcolm X.. Now. Makes clear when those

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000
four kids was killed in Birmingham member said the negro should fight the white man but do you

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
remember when those movement was killed in

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
L.A.. The movement was killed in L.A. Remember

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000
that they didn't fight. So the move will not go on fighting why the

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
negroes know the fight in Alabama.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
You see if you look through the things that have been said by Malcolm and filter

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
mouth and find out the myths from the

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
truth than you will understand Malcolm. What's the truth. Now you say a movement stands

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000
for violence right.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
You say that can you call one incidence which you know moves and been

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
violent and I can quote many statements that he says I

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000
said in face statement if I tell you I'm a millionaire. Are you going to tell the world I'm

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:42.000
a

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
millionaire or you know. All right then why

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Americans they want safety we assume what we want to

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
assume. But there are many examples just recently in the news and up in Harlem the youth gangs that

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
are murdering for the sake of murdering and this was to be under the influence is not a mix of

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
like most what I tell you the best person I asked wouldn't be me because I don't live here but I tell you what if you actually

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Polish Commission here in New York I bet he couldn't tell us what it is and I'm sure if it was he would

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
know but he's never confirmed

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
that and they usually confirm everything of that nature.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
You see when a negro up in Harlem is supposed to be killing white for the sake of killing white then

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
another negro if I asked about it but when a white man supposed to be secure and colored for the sake of

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
killing color. They never asked a negro about that questions are so unfair not even when

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000
they mean to

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
be all the ones we have to be responsible for Negroes but whites

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
only responsible to themselves. You see when a white man rapes a four year old girl.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
And the next day a white man come to my neighborhood to sell me my product. I never Graham my daughter

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000
away like he's going to rape

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000
her when a white man puts forty sticks of dynamite

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
in his mother's luggage and blog whole plane up when a white man come to my neighborhood to sell my product with

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
his little valise a little briefcase. I don't assume is dynamite in

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
it you see the day the white man learned to be a. Spare the

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
negro the example the people are living on Kennedy down

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
on Johnson's wife's

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
poverty ranch. I wonder how many whites would have been that

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
loyal. This is different the day the white man learned to be a law

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
in America as a

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000
negro we have something going on you see the white man owns this country have all the

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
privileges and is the white man who gives the secrets

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000
away and there are many negroes who work in access of

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000
secret them in a negro who knows a lot of secrets because he was a

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
negro involve the universal Chicago when he split that

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
Adam and final has given the secrets away.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Well who is

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000
loyal the last friend this American white man have it Earth goes

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000
around the world he is hated and if he ever take a world trip when he go to France

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.000
he hang around in the American section where he's been and his big butt the book but if

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
he ever lose that American section here finally what people think about

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000
him and South Vietnam right now are we fighting a war

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
the American Whites cannot even go into the town because of the atrocities they committed

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
with the cab drivers that you tell me we're going to fight and save a

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000
country has more to be teaching them freedom and their own white boys can go in town

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
because of the attitudes because of the attitudes towards

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000
them all over this country. I think you've just come from a meeting of the

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
young gang leaders in New York City. What is their

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
attitude when talking about juvenile gang leaders you talk

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
about poor folks. I made a

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
joke

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
that had we really want to direct the World's

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Fair we would have cancelled the Starlin invited all society kids down from

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Southampton. But when they do something.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
It's not a problem.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
It's when the mother on a D C It's one Negro one with illegitimate Keir but we forget

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
about the white woman to get the boys and cry. Card You see we put the old

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:03.000
people in

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000
projects and we name I'm such a such a project. You have a head dress right where

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
you live when I give you my

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
address why we got to call it a name you have name nothing

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
else just give you the street an

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
address and give him a telephone you will as all people live in the projects don't

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000
have

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000
telephones have some relief. You're not supposed to have a telephone.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Do you realize the people I live in the projects that they don't have

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
doorbells So if you had to walk up twenty five twenty seven stories on the elevator you have to go

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
all the way up those wear them stories and knock on the door do you know they don't given

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
doorbells So when you spend this type of money to build a new place

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
and all you do is build it for poor

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000
folks and you're not going to help them at

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
all you haven't better. They condition as far as being

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
poor as far as convenience.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000
You better your

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000
condition because all we do is put them in you have doctors. That's in terms

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000
that should live in the projects because you have doctors are doing in turn workers making less

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000
money than mother on

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:17.000
relief and can you imagine what this gang leader would do when he got a doctor living in his building.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000
He'd have somebody when they

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
imitate somebody that he feels is his own to

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
imitate juvenile gang lead in the street he have to be a gang leader in the street

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000
juvenile delinquency in America to me is nothing but the style

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000
does after the finished product have been

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000
pedal

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000
ISM so we have these gang

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
leaders and the only way we're going to solve the problem is getting at the base the root of

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000
the

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
problem go into the home follow him from the time

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000
old to the time he's

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000
twenty you see when one about high school

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000
dropouts you have a kid that's not eaten but one meal a day at

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000
home. Or maybe he's not even at home at all we give him what

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000
a lunch at school.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000
How do you expect in the

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000
study after he played baseball and basketball and he goes home is hungry mom I have

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000
a new food for

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000
him but you go on the Brahmachari and you feed him

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000
why knows you feed

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000
them about a kid whose dad is over there on the

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000
Bollen getting fed and he's in the projects and not eaten.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
That's the one you learn about falling out of

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000
school Feed him. See to it fill up a

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000
program get your laundry mat go

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000
on for janitor you pay the damages

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000
nice schools in New York for a thousand dollars a

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
year then do it

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000
different pay him thirty thousand dollars a year and get your laundry warm and see to it that

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:51.000
the

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000
kids can bring their dirty clothes the school WOLLASTON In school eight hours a day.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000
The woman downstairs washing the

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000
well see to see if you see to it that a man has

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
a clean body he'll see to it he has a

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000
clean mind. It's very hard to have a clean mind what a dirty body is hard to

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
think clean when your feet.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000
Think how much of what needs to be done is being done

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000
using about one tenth of one

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000
percent because we so busy.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000
We're so busy what our system set up that is so corrupt the way we treat Nigro we have to bend

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
over backwards to everybody else in the world or you know we can build a hospital in

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000
India today. You know that don't you and

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000
all Indians can go to that hospital you know that don't you. But do you know the federal government built a hospital here in

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000
New York only veterans could go.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000
Can you believe that the federal government bills the House bill and not one American kid can

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:55.000
go where they build it and then the Indians can go.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000
This is the problem we

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000
have we need more money for Vietnam for Laos.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000
And they pushed one hundred thirty two million dollars through just like

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:10.000
that but if you needed it for a new yard. You couldn't get it.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
That's the problem we have in this country today. What's your forecast what's going to happen. Well as the rate we

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
go and now we're headed to complete destruction.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.000
It's like fighting a forest fire. We don't get a shift in when we can kiss it goodbye.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000
I'm hoping and praying for this

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000
year we can get it while I have that much freedom

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000
people the Negro is

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000
demonstrating demonstrating for legitimate

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000
right he has truth justice and United States Constitution on his

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000
side he gets knocked down by a car.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000
There's a cold air inhaling going to judge a senator like

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000
Russell have to ask the F.B.I. are to come in and investigate police

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
brutality towards negroes in New York and Bill

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
for this is a disgrace. When you stop and think we will take

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000
a girl and a soldier and make the University of Mississippi

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000
integrate and make Mississippi and Alabama integrate but when we asked you to integrate in New York you give

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000
us the most.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Is degree I want to thank you.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000
You've been listening to an interview with the negro comedian Dick Gregory. Thank

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
you and goodbye for now.
