But Rachel Mark's interview each week at this time your station bring to

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
an interview with a leading figure in the arts politics or the sirens. I'm here now

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
to introduce this afternoon's guest. Patrice

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
earmarks the art of light or Lumia as it's sometimes called uses

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
life itself as its medium and combines color form in motion

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
to create an independent

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
art form. I'm delighted to have as my guest today.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Thomas Wilfred the great pioneer of luminal art.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Mr Wilfred was born in Denmark in eight hundred eighty nine and came to the United States in

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
one thousand nine hundred sixteen to devote his full time to the art of

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Lumia in one thousand nine hundred he developed a crab a lox and

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
organ like. Instrument controlled by sliding keys which project colors onto a

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
screen in one thousand nine hundred eighty eight Mr Wilfred developed the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
first self-contained automatic Clavell

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
X. Mr Wilfred. Werman How did you first become interested in the art of light.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
It's a hard question to answer because I've always been interested.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
My first impression in this world came to

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
me when I was two years old I remember nothing before that

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
my mother had just died and one day the nurse took me into

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
my father's office I could have been but a couple of

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
months older than two years in the sun was shining in there

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and father to cheer me up took a Crystal

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Egg mounted on a letter press and moved it in

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
the sun being.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And the ceiling suddenly became covered with little traveling dots of spectral

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
color and follows that I was green with the light and every time I came into the

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
office he had to do that for me again and I was so disappointed whenever there was

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
no sun and therefore no. Spectrums but

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
could be seen dancing. Know from then on.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000
The best thing I can say is that I've never been able to leave it alone.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
It has demanded my time and my

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
imagination and my vision. Ever

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
since so I

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
left Denmark when I was nineteen he began to study

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
art both music and sculpture and painting

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
because I wanted to get the various approaches

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
to any moving art. But light was

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
back of it

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
all the driving spring. To I found

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
some teaches both in Germany and France and in England.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Who consented to teach me what I wanted to know when nothing else.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
What was that what kind of things did you want to

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
know just what concerns you late and

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
why certain think

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
this were more successful in portraying light and effect the light

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
than others. And then finally I came to

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
the conclusion that light itself is necessary.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
You cannot think light convincingly because

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
light moves. It's part of the

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
universal flux and therefore motion is a

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
necessary to mention and factor and any visual

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
art involving late so I built several

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
instruments in one

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
thousand five when I was sixteen I cut some

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
holes no cigar box put a small electric bulb

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
inside got some colored glass from the place

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
year and. To project patterns in the ceiling.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And nobody thought much of it was just

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
a young man's fancy to get tired of that.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
But when I came to Paris and started studying art there

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
I got packing boxes and I got more lamps and so on. And I

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
kept building. And one night I invited

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
my

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
teacher painting up to my little room and I said I want to

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
show you something I've been working on and I showed him.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Some crew. Developments of foam color and motion on the

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000
screen and I was waiting for his approval.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000
But he folded his arms over his chest and said Look my boy.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000
This will lead you nowhere. With this on your mind you'll never learn to paint.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Well he was right about that one thing but I could not leave it alone.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And I kept it up but I also had to make a living I found out I

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000
had a goodbye tone of voice and I liked over songs.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.000
So

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
I found a new twelve string lute and I began to practice

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
in saying I knew she would old songs to the

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
loot and that took.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And I made money on it so my pussy would be go

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
out through the window and sing til you have funds

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
enough then spend the summer experimenting to you go

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
broke then go back and sing some more. And

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
that lasted in reality until

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
the war program just before the war nine hundred fourteen.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
I was given the right to command any. England to appear in

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
court and of course after that the engagements multiplied because what's

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
good enough for the royal

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
family is good enough for everybody but then came the war and that was

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
the end of that I came over here to the United States in one thousand nine hundred

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
sixteen and why did you come to the state because I wanted to

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
try and see if my work.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.000
WOULD FIND A BETTER. So I hear a more open mind.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
But I continued the old the routine of going out on

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
song recitals in the wind and experiment in the summer

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
until nineteen nineteen.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Then I suddenly told my manager no more song recitals

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
and he was heartbroken. Heavens

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
man you're making big money. I said Yes but everybody can

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
sing but very few people have the patience to deal with this work.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
So from nineteen nineteen to nineteen twenty two.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
I had a laboratory in Huntington Long

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Island out in the birch woods and I built their

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
first clearly looks which I call it an instrument

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
which from which you could play light by key that is you

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000
had some command or form and motion and color.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
And then in January nineteen twenty two I

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
played the first public performances in New

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
York in the concerts that you gave in the United

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
States and Canada and eventually Europe in the

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
twenty's was the form of of this club Aleck's. Was

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
it substantially different from what one can see now say in

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
the Museum of Modern Art return to school years. Can

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:57.000
you

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
describe the industry. Conversations were much

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
shorter and much more rigid in structure. Some of them you could

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
almost compare to the few in that I

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
was very rated I was very young and still very rigid in my outlook

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
on conversation.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
With this mean that the patterns were clearly defined. Yes just really hard well not just fine

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
not too hard no I've never believed in too hard.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
But they were rather uniform and movement and in

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
color changes and so on because I played there from notation by moving the keys on

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
the keyboard with a regular performance in

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
silence and I had

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
a different instrument several new instruments and one I took to your the nine hundred

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
twenty five was quite a nice looking

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000
aluminum instrument with five

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000
manuals that could be set up in a few hours. I played Paris.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
I played the old Queen's Hall in

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
London and when I came to my native country Denmark the

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
government invited me to play in the Royal Opera House in the middle of the summer it was opened up.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
For just one performance and all the artists and writers were

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
invited by government invitation to come and see the place

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
was full and it has never happened before or since that they've opened

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
that the opera house in the summer for any one

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
single individual so I was very proud of

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
that do you find it performing your pieces on the club

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
likes the

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
performance itself something that you feel adds to the fact in contrast

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
to larger and more contemporary pieces you've done recently who wears

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
the patterns are determined controlled

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000
by

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Yannick devices because at the keyboard. You have the same freedom.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
That a pianist has interpreted another composer's work

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
if some day you feel a little at a

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
rapid tempo you can do it if someday you feel you want to emphasize

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
a certain Carlo others you can do it whereas once you have recorded the

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
conversation that is it it's like a phonograph record no

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
change possible. Can you actually improvise.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
So yes. Improvisation is fun and

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
some conversations have come out of moments in improvisation

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000
which I've suddenly seen a combination. I didn't know could be done.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Do you do this anymore you so you have an instrument in which

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
you perform No we know because we have no more room

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
when the audience who like closed in Grand Central

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Palace. And the war came on we had to warehouse all our

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
things and we never were able to build up a membership again so a

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
lot remains warehoused and no I have

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
specialized in these smaller compositions which I can do then

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
which can be placed in museums and private

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
homes rather than try to book their sidles with a large

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
instrument where we sighed as I no longer want it because radio and

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
television and these big combines have taken everything

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
over to everything in one hundred thirty. You founded the Art

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Institute of light and evidently there was

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
a theater in studio under the auspices of the Institute in New York City

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
from one thousand nine hundred three to one nine hundred forty three Yes Can you describe at all what

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
kind of work went on both at the institute and at the theater at the

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
zoo I realized that in terms of just one man

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
their work would never mean very much. That other artists

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
should be able to express themselves through it.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
And so I laid the foundation for the Art Institute of light a

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
nonprofit organization. And we got some kind of a membership

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:14.000
build

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
up. And in Grand Central Palace. We

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
had rigged up a Lumia theater holding about eighty

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
people with a large screen and a very large instrument

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
of some thirty two project this and it keyboard room behind

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
the audience from which the player could looking over the audience and

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
see the screen.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
They were sidles would be in two groups of say four compositions

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
each and I would give a little introduction before

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
each and that became very

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
popular their art schools in the colleges and the students and on Friday

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
nights it was for the general public. And we

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
had a great many people there who enjoyed the

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
work but then of course in

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
nineteen forty two the war hit

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
us and their army moved into the building for too good

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
for recruiting send our

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
staff was called into the various armed forces and I was taken into

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000
government

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
service as a radio man radio editor

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
an announcer new Deniz language.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Sending shortwave News in the Danish

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
language across the seas re times a day for two

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.000
years now when finally all that was over in one thousand nine hundred five.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
It was no time to start

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000
anything and all the big instruments were

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:59.000
warehoused no room to set them up. No room to arrange a theater. Nolo.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Vailable to build anything at all but a

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
small very small studio. So I turn

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
myself to with a smaller compositions which I could do it my

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
leisure and which when

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
finished represented one single conversation that

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
was sold as such as you would sell a painting or piece of

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000
sculpture and that has gone on from then on

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
but the idea of getting students to come

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
in did not work because we had no

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
money to support them while they were

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
there with the students before performing

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Lumia both were but actually

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
motivating mostly they would be they would be paying this who wanted to work in

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000
the medium. And those days appearing just didn't like it very

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
much so several of them dropped out and I asked some

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:02.000
of them and they

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000
said we talked to some of our friends and they said.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
If you touch that you ostracized by the rest of us. So really that stuff alone they

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.000
were for afraid of it very much afraid of what the Lumia lot of light would do to a painting.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
And no of course the realize there's nothing to be afraid of because it's in an

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
entirely different art form.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
It's a nod to be performed in a concert

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
hall and it will be that way when

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
in later years. It builds up.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
I wonder if if you would describe what Louis. Is what is the art

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000
of like.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
If you take their art of sound music.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
You have mellowed e Harmony and rhythm. You may

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
say there's three dimensions that right dangerous to one

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
another but I. Often has musicians.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
What is the

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
basic factor in

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
music the very basic thing you build

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
on and return to

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
what I said Not really I said no it is

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
not it is silence because

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000
no conductor raises his but until he has

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
produced silence in the concert

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
hall and take an elaborate precautions to MONTAGNE it solidly under

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
the structure of sound his building when he returns to

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
silence for a fragment of a second before

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
they applause breaks in so silence

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
is the basic

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
factor in music. No in Lumia the basic

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
factor is darkness and complete darkness. You must begin with

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
that not only that but you must begin

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
imagining

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
endless dark space in front of you so that you are limited to build

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
the phone miles out. And move it and make it

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000
come toward you and make it in luggage and make it passing over you as slow you were

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
sitting in some fat test expense.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Ship with a huge window on the nose and

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.000
by means of manipulating the controls which in this case is a keyboard.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000
You could either

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
travel through this fantastic world you were building out there or form color and

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
motion or you could stay at one juncture

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
between space and time and let all the things pass you

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000
in review.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
No that is evasion. No you must realize it.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000
You must materialize it so what other people can see. And the

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
big window in the nose of the spaceship becomes a white screen a two

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000
dimensional white screen. The moving operatic

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000
as the propelling device becomes a number of

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
powerful project is and the control panel

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000
becomes a loom the keyboard a cleverly looks keyboard.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
And then you must perform the composition in such a

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000
way that your spectators. Will again feel they're

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:33.000
looking

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
out through a window into infinite

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000
space that is just this physical link in between that you

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:48.000
must know how to pass through in order to express it to someone besides yourself.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
There is a basics of Lumia Mr

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Wizard what can the artist express through Lumia more effectively then

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
to older art forms.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Basically the majestic their own earthly.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000
That which is not connected with the activities and

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
movements of the human being in other words

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000
space visions. But that is not the

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
only direction that is the main

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000
direction the composer Lumia

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
may just as easily take his audience in Israel a dance

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
hall or us were crowded city

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
street or through beautiful suspension

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
bridge that he can enjoy the music of the interlacing Stieg a good

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
US or indeed a primeval

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
forest all those things are possible.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Not only that but you can in this art form

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
express abstract human enough from the. It

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
does not involve the whom being whatever.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000
And I have worked some with it in the past and it

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:09.000
promises

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000
well how how do you actually do that when you can you can you verbalize

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000
it all.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
Yes you do it by sudden unexpected movements of

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000
smaller

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000
forms can you are you track to two representational forms.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Could you use human forms

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000
or I don't want to do that personally it would probably be

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000
done extensively because something about the human form

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
that especially the female

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.000
form that has fascinated and will always fascinated.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000
In painting and motion pictures that is fine and

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:55.000
this art form it becomes more difficult it becomes one burnish.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
That at least I will not there are going to vote there will be

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
many who will come and do their best or their worst whatever you

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000
feel in representing the human form.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000
I like to quote something from one of your writings and ask you to speak about a little

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
more you said. Shall we continue to dramatize our floundering in the muddy

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
waters of rank materialism or dedicate the new art as a vehicle for a new

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
message and first of all express what light has

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000
always symbolized a longing for a greater reality a cosmic

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000
consciousness a balance between the human entity and the great common denominator

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
the universal rhythmic flow.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
I wonder if you tell us a little more what you what you mean by this. And what you're trying

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
to express through

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Lumia I mean merely this think I've said once before

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000
that they aren't from this peculiar yet that that to their

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
An earthly

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
they and.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Therefore the composition pattern will naturally be different.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
There will be less obvious climax and there would be much

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
more even flow the climax will be implied

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:15.000
instead of

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
actually shown and

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
executed and some of those

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000
compositions will be closed conversations in that they will have no beginning

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000
and no end because those are the phenomena means

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
in nature. There's no beginning and no end you come out to look at

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:43.000
the starless night that hasn't just been turned on because you open the door.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000
It's then you can look at it as long as you like you go in and

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000
it continuous therefore I like to build closed

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
compositions where as a beginning with the end there isn't any close conversation the

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000
circular it repeats rule with variation.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000
What is the source of most of your the inspiration is it largely nature you speak.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000
Yeah a little about me.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000
Yes nature and then certain visions that

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000
I've had. I've always striving for peace of

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000
mind silence in which to be able

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000
to really think really contemplate. And

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000
those things come when you are alone and you were

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000
silent and you

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000
uninterrupted. But no other

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
time and

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000
therefore those who really want to express things in this must seek

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
that and must know how to benefit by

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000
it and he said billet is

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000
their vision is that behind them something comes and

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000
is clearly expressed and clearly enjoyed by the audience.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000
If it's just a display of changing color. It means nothing to

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000
anybody does this kind of vision or piece of

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000
mind come to most easily in the

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000
country. I like to be I've

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000
always disliked living in the city. It was necessary for a

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000
great many years but no

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:27.000
as soon as I could I got away from it to a little house.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
Well in the wireless a field isn't Littlewoods and so

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
on where at night you have absolute

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000
silence and I can sit

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000
from the time the rest of the household goes to sleep in until

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:48.000
I feel I want to go to bed. And nothing

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000
disturbed nothing at all.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Do you actually in this in shapes that.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000
You then embody in such as a composer might hear a

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
melody or shape or

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000
color for yes I do. And then of course I have to

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:13.000
translate that and say to myself I would like to create that shape and make it.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
Mozart's And so now can I do

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000
it technically

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000
I do many other limitations. Sometimes for

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:27.000
you for lots of limitations. They are the art form is in its infancy.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:33.000
What we shall see if humanity stays alive long enough.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000
Will not be indicated by anything done today. Because the Johansson save

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000
us young buck a roomier has not yet been born or at least he

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.000
may be in grade school now and when the first reader genius expresses

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000
himself through this art

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000
form with the instruments at his fingertips that

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
he can express things through then we may see something entirely different.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.000
But their art form is here to stay. We might as well get acquainted with it.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Because it's one of the great arts.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000
You remember what the Cheney said in his book about it. Well that was

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000
prophetic because that was said in nineteen twenty

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000
three Sheldon Cheney there right on art an art critic.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Came to most through you know Huntington and after having seen the recital as.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000
He wrote in his book a Prima modern art.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Here is a beginning or at least the first serious achievement

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:38.000
of an

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000
art as primitive as complex as capable

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000
of varied emotional beauty is music and its medium is

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000
light that light which was it early Scott of human

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000
kind which to this day to this size all that is spiritual

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000
joy bringing and

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000
radiant perhaps then this is the beginning of the

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
greatest the most spiritual and radiant

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:12.000
art or. Mr Wilfrid I want to thank you for this interview.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:18.000
My guest has been the great pioneer of the art of light. Thomas Wilfrid.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Thank you and goodbye for

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.000
now you have been listening to Patricia Marx interview. Joanna's again

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000
next week when once again we bring you a question mark

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000
interview.
