00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm delighted to have as my guest today Professor Howard Zinn who recently spent seven

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
years as chairman of the history department at Stillman College which is a

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
predominantly Negro school in Atlanta Georgia. During this time professors

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
in observed and participated in the civil rights

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
struggle and has just written two books out of this personally experience.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
One entitled The new

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
abolitionists is about the activists civil rights group the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The other in title the southern mystique challenges are accepted views of the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
South and race prejudice. This isn't just what you mean by the Southern mystique.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
There's a certain atmosphere built up around the south in history books.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I guess in our literature in the folklore of the nation.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And this in the final feeling about

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
the South somehow was one of

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
mystery and that people somehow had gotten a

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
notion through this long tradition of literature and history and

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
folklore that the South

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
was an unfathomable quantity that it was so different

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
from the rest of the nation that there was no point in attempting to

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
penetrate this mystery.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And as I observe the actions and the ideas in action of

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
white Southerners a negro sudden was about

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
me I began to realize that the South was very much like the rest of

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
the nation that it was not unfathomable not mysterious not

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
indecipherable that it was subject to rational consideration and analysis and

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
thought that something like race prejudice for

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
instance which so many not only American

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Northerners but perhaps people all over the world have begun to think is something ingrained

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and mysterious in the southern white that this race.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
This is really something understandable and something with which you can

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
grapple and something you can

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
change it isn't really known such as lynchings

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
in for segregation murders isn't what we know about the South that makes us

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
feel race prejudice is unfathomable an

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
unchangeable Well these are the facts and these are true that is the

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
mystery as I think all mysteries. The mystery is

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
based on an element of truth. The South has been more

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
violent has been more prejudiced has reacted in the

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
most terrifying ways to negroes has killed

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and the most Negroes and brutalized them more

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
than any other section of the nation. This is true what is not

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
true

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
however is the idea that this therefore is an

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
unchangeable part of the self that this has always been in the south and

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
will always be there and nothing we can do will erase this feeling in

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
the minds of white Southerners in this pattern of action that they have

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
had throughout history.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
It's often said that one must wait to change men's hearts before wind changes

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
their laws. I do agree with this.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I think this is one of the fundamental points in the southern

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
city and I suppose one of the reasons I set

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
out to write it

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
because Americans concerned with the race problem. I think

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
particularly liberal Americans have long said well the way to get

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
at the problem is to change first the thinking of man the feelings of

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
man mainly by education.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Which meant mainly by verbal education and then this would have an effect on the

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
situation in the south. And what I began. To see a

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
living at a ladder. Through seven years of very intense

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
change. Those exactly those seven years in which the south has been going through

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
this great turmoil.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
For one hundred fifty six two years after the Supreme Court decision to nineteen.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Sixty three and what I saw in

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
these seven

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
years was that white southerners began to change

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
their patterns of behavior before they changed their way of thinking and they did this

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
because several things happened because

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
one laws of the community

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
change and second the

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
atmosphere in the community that which is created by the predominant opinion

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
of editors ministers professors and all of the powerful organs of opinion in

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
the community. All of these

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
things began to create a different atmosphere and this changed

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
atmosphere not some internal change in the way of thinking this changed atmosphere and the

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
changed legal situation which led them to change their behavior even before they change

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.000
their

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
minds and my argument is that what you really do is first

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
change the way people behave by creating a new environment around them and as they begin

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
to behave differently. They begin to think

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
differently. And this is based I suppose on

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
the idea that people's

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
behavior does not come as much out of some

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
internalized thought process as it does out of the behavior they see.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
About them whether this is consistent with their internal thinking and that there are so many people go through

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
life behaving in a way that they don't think they should

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
behave simply because this. These are the laws of society. And these are the

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
patterns and the mores and I'm saying you change the mores you change the environment of the

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000
white

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Southern you change the way behaves and then you change the way of

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
thinking. I mean changing the way he behaves strictly through law.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Not strictly but this is one way. I think at one point in the

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
book I mention this incident on the

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
bus which a student of mine. Experience she that this was

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
a class. I suppose we weren't supposed to be discussing this in class but you know

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
we teachers get off on things and students get off on things and I was happy to let it get

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.000
off this

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
way she told about an incident that happened that

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
morning and was the morning after the busses had been legally the

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
segregated in the federal courthouse in Atlanta. This is a

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Negro girl a student of mine and she'd gotten on the

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
bus and she saw a Negro man sitting in the front of the

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
bus the very first morning after the court had said now it is legal

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
for Negroes to sit in front of the bus. And then a white woman got on to

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
the bus saw this negro man sitting in the front asked him to move. He wouldn't move.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
He said you know don't read the newspapers

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
very quietly and then she appealed to the bus driver or white Southern bus driver.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Well whose feelings on race you can well imagine mirrored those of the

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000
community and of

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
tradition and the bus driver

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
wouldn't do anything he called the policeman because she insisted on the policeman got

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
on and when the white woman asked the policeman to remove the negro man the policeman turned to the woman

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000
said to

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
her very quietly man don't you read the newspapers in other words

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
the white policeman the white bus driver both of them undoubtedly in their

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000
minds

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
segregationists were immediately within twenty four hours conforming to a judgment of the court

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
whether they liked it or not and what this meant was that from this point on Negroes and

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000
whites would be

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
sitting not fully integrated. But at least partly integrated

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
and occasionally integrated in the buses in little white children growing up in

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Atlanta and seeing occasionally Negro sitting next to whites on the

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
buses would think differently than did their forebears their fathers and

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
their grandfathers who grew up always seeing whites and negroes sitting in their

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
places thinking will change now.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
What does that mean that there are things that are more important to the sudden you're other than segregation.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
I think this is this is precisely the point

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
that all of us.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
The white Southerner is like all of

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
us to me is very important consideration. He's a

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
human being as we all are and I think we all have a certain set of

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
values which are arranged in a kind of hierarchy.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Some are more important than others. And for the white Southerner and this sort of

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
crashed in on me one day on one mass while I was in the south the white

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
southerner has always valued segregation.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000
But

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
never almost never more than other things which mean more to him when

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000
the white southerners confronted with a

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
choice between losing his

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
cherished racial traditions and losing something which he values

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
even more it may be his freedom. It may be

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
something economic It may be the good opinion of the community.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
But when he faces a choice between those he will give up or a

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
certain Mr Finn you've been speaking about as a man to your experience a letter which

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
is considered the model city of race relations and I wonder whether

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
this experience would apply to the Deep South the rest of the Deep South which

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
is known for its violent reaction to integration.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
It doesn't apply as quickly and it doesn't apply as fully but I

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
think it up. Flies in

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
time

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
I left Atlanta in winter of one thousand nine hundred sixty one to go

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
into Albany Georgia which

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
is as different from the latter as Mississippi is from Massachusetts and

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
this is the hardcore slave plantations south and then I saw I

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
saw the kind of south you're talking about the south of

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
lynchings were really the odor of slavery still

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
lingers in Albany at that time looked as if it would never become

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
another ladder but today it is moving in that direction. The library has

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
been the segregated in Albany the bus stops in a train stations and the segregated schools have

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000
begun to be

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
desegregated a Negro has run for Congress in Albany Georgia he didn't win

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
but he he got votes and he will get more votes.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
There's a slightly different atmosphere in Albany Georgia today I've been in this city and in

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Alabama and some of those places most of those places today still

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
remain intransigent in fact they look today like Atlanta looked eighty years

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
ago but Jackson Mississippi. A few months

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
ago and you know Mississippi is the worst

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
in Jackson Mississippi.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
A few months ago saw the peaceful admission of

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Negro children to white schools in a number of communities

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
throughout the state and what this meant was that the police chief the

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
mayor and certain citizens of those communities decided that

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
peace was more important

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
than segregation and so they saw trouble coming and they knew what had happened

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
at Little Rock and other places where the South had put up resistance to the desegregation

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000
of schools and it'll last in the

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
end and they decided we must give in and because they are giving

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
in because they are they haven't changed their minds but they're changing a behavior because of

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
this little white children in Jackson Mississippi will go to. With a little Negro children for the

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
first time and I think they'll grow

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
up different How effective has the civil rights movement the activist groups

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
been promoting the cause of

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.000
equality Well they are the they are the critical element in the situation.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Because

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
the courts alone can only issue the Crees Congress alone can only

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
pass laws as the civil rights movement had not gotten to the streets. Starting

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000
with the Montgomery bus

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
boycott and then moving into the sittings of one nine hundred sixty in the

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
freedom rides in one thousand nine hundred sixty one in the street demonstrations in Albany in sixty two

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000
and the great great thrusts of energy by

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
mass movements of negroes in the streets of Birmingham and Jackson everywhere else in

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000
the south and sixty

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
three if if all of this had not taken place then

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
the civil rights laws passed by Congress the decisions made by the

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Supreme Court would have remained as dead as the fourteenth Amendment did

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
from eighteen seventy two one hundred fifty

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
four this the civil rights movements the and this means mainly the

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Negro people in the

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
south they really have given force behind whatever

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
legal decisions are made by the

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
government there in the south an element in the Negro population that is much

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
more conservative than you would be or the activists would be. And isn't this a

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
force that you have to combat also.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
There is and

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
there are conservative negroes. I know because I lived

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
among them. I lived on a Negro college

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
campus and Negro schoolteachers Negro college professors

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Negro college presidents a negro businessman and he grown surance men

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
have sometimes managed to carve out a certain way of life for

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
themselves even. In the segregated south

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
which protects them from the worst excesses of the system and which makes them

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
complacent. Not all of them but but many of them.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
But what has been interesting is the way these conservatives Negro conservatives in the

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
south have in the face of this great outpouring of militancy by

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
young negroes all around them these conservative had to keep

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
quiet and today a Negro is called conservative when he is simply not as

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:30.000
radical

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
as the next what I call the the extreme groups the

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
very militant groups.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Did you find it difficult being more radical yourself to work with a more establishment administration

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000
in

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
college I found it difficult and I found

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
it marvelous I found it difficult

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
because yes I

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
irritated I'm sure

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
my college president and

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000
the deans of women and some of the

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
teachers and some of the more conservative elements in the community just as

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
I probably irritated white segregationist leaders

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
in the Atlantic community but on the other

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000
hand the students themselves who who were the heart of

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
the salute and my own students and other students who went into the restaurants and sat in the

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000
march downtown in the face

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
of helmeted state troopers guarding the state capitol against their

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
entrance and well the students were so happy that they could find

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000
a college professor a two or three of four who would go with them who would march with them who would sit with

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
them that this made up for

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
everything was the treatment that they received in the jails is that a very brutal kind

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
of treatment.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000
This. It's a hard thing to talk about not tell you

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
why it's like asking was slavery brought.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
And after all not all slaves were whipped and maybe only some slaves were whipped and most

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
of them were just slaves.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000
There are some institutions which are brutal in themselves just in the

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:21.000
ordinary day to day living out of that institution and being in jail.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Anywhere is brutal simply because you're deprived of your freedom. And I guess what

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:26.000
is

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
most most damaging is the thought that you're

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
there unjustly. But Southern

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
jails

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
and Southern jails in the Deep South in Albany Georgia in Selma

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Alabama in Jackson Mississippi in the Coleman Hattiesburg. And in these other hard

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
core areas of the South unspeakable. They're

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
the jailers or brutes there you

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
are people are beaten.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Well just just almost

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
exactly a year ago that I walked

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
into the jail house in Hattiesburg Mississippi to bail

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
out a young White Snake worker that is a work of the

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. The young recent graduate of Yale Law School who

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
decided not to go into corporate law on Wall Street but

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
to go into Mississippi and work with the movement. And he went to jail because picked

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
up as so many civil rights workers were picked up

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
on false traffic charges and kept in jail

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
overnight and came to take him out of jail and came

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000
down the Karda blood all over him

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
and his shirt and his pants his nose broken

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
his face was

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
gashed he had been given a working over in the jail. The night

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
before and spent the night in the

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000
semi senseless and bleeding condition. And this is

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
happens so many so many times in southern jails and what is the

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
most terrible thing about it is this is happened in

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000
a federal government where the national.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Administration has all the legal and actual power to prevent this but has not

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:20.000
moved

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000
to prevent this you spoke quite critically of the federal government in

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000
not doing what it could do I wonder if you would talk about that a little bit.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
There's been a great deal of misinformation misinformation to a great extent spread by

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
the federal government itself about its

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
own role in this. Let's take the murder

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:50.000
of three young civil rights workers in Mississippi.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
Last June June twenty

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000
first this could have been prevented if the federal government had

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
acted with the power that it has legally but for years

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
now and but for years I mean. Ever since the civil rights movement began

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
in earnest with the sit ins in one nine hundred

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
sixty brutality and murder have taken place in

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
the south where the federal government keeping out

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
of it and maintaining that it was

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
not within its power to do anything about the

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
situation in actuality the number of laws on the

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000
statute books of the United States

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000
government. Which make it a federal offense for

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.000
any person

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
to deprive any other person of his constitutional rights.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000
What this means is that anybody who does this is violating a federal law.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.000
What this means also is that any federal agent an F.B.I. agent.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
For instance or another agent can arrest such a

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
person for violating such a law but in instance after

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
instance. Federal agents members of the F.B.I. stood by and watched people being

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000
beaten or watched people being taken away to jail and didn't do a thing about it didn't step in

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000
didn't make an arrest didn't act according to federal law. The reason of course is a political

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
one that the federal government throughout its history and even

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
today plays a cautious role. To the rest of the world it seems

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000
as if the federal government plays a very active role they see the civil rights bill of fifty seven

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:26.000
passed in

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000
the civil rights law of one thousand nine hundred sixty and civil rights law in one thousand nine hundred sixty

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000
four and they don't see how much sweat and agony. How much marching and

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000
parading and how many beatings and how many

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
murders went into. That

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000
bill that finally emerged and then they don't see how difficult it is to get the federal government to

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
enforce these laws. Once they are passed.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000
What do you think can be done by the citizens to activate.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000
One thing they might

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000
do is to simply let it be known in some way

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000
to their congressman to the president to the Department of Justice publicly in newspapers and letters to

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000
the newspapers with

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000
every every power that words can

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000
give them. Let it be known that they know that the federal government

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000
can act according to law to send a

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000
protective force of federal agents into the deep south where ever civil rights are being

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000
violated in to prevent murders before they begin to take place.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000
There is a law on the books passed a very long time ago.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
Section three thirty three Title ten of the United States

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Code and this law says that whenever any state is unable

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000
or fails or is unwilling to protect the constitutional rights of any citizen of

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
that state then the president may use any

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
means he wishes to protect those

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
rights. This means not only that the president can send troops which

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000
at this point are not urging But it means that the federal. That the president if he

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:08.000
wants

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000
to can create for instance special forces. Federal agents.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Preferably not the F.B.I. because they're not enthusiastic about civil

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
rights a Special Forces federal

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000
agents which will be stationed at trouble

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
points in the south and which

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000
will act to protect civil rights workers in the grows from violence

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
and from deprivation of their rights and which will act simply as a protective force as

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
a screen as soon as this is set up I would estimate

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
that the situation were going to change radically deputy sheriffs and sheriffs will not

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000
behave with the brutality that they have behaved behave this way because they felt immune

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000
and because they've been immune. It's time to take away the

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000
simulated this isn't what you call them true with this in effect setting

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
up a federal police state.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000
No it wouldn't be setting up a federal police state what it would be doing would be to

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000
set up a branch of the federal government which

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000
enforces one part of federal law in the same way that

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
federal revenue. Agents

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
enforce fiscal law and in the same way that F.B.I. agents and

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
force laws against interstate kidnapping interstate auto theft

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
embezzlement use of the mails to the fraud and so

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000
on you see we have federal laws in the south. Which federal

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000
agents right now in force acting as Federal Policeman. But the

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000
one kind of

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000
law which has remained immune from enforcement in the

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000
south has been civil rights law and all that I'm suggesting is that civil rights

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000
laws be placed on the same footing as all other other laws that a

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
sheriff who drags a civil rights worker into jail and beats

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.000
him be treated as a bank robber. Is treated who

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
is immediately apprehended by the F.B.I. and thrown into the federal penitentiary to go through the

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000
judicial

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000
process citizen you've been talking about both the progress and the deep rooted violence.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:20.000
What is your forecast in ten years what will the. Progress be in terms of race relations.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Oh I think I don't think it's hard to forecast.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000
I hesitate to forecast for this reason because too many of

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000
us and I include myself here.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
Forecast from a standpoint of passive A-D. those we want to stand by

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
and watch how things

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000
develop and I think the only reasonable forecasts

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000
that can be made is one that's based on. Action. I think if

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
we forecast. From the standpoint of

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000
acting ourselves then we can predict that very good and positive

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000
favorable things are going to take place in the south in the area of really race relations in the next ten years.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000
What short is going down and being a snake worker or a

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.000
professor of history it's Norman college. What can a responsible individual do

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
that without to you know pattern of his

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
life. Well that changing the whole pattern of his

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
life. Of course this is an

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000
important phrase it would be good if we could change

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000
the patterns of our lives so many people have I mean reshaping your

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000
life in terms of what you see about you for the first time and what you spend your spare time

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000
doing and the fact that you become aware perhaps of the Negro community where you live

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
in a way that you never were before because negroes are invisible wherever they live in the north and in the

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000
south and. It's interesting that white Northerners see negroes

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000
in Mississippi now in the headlines before they see the negroes living around the corner and they become

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000
aware of this to become aware of the

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.000
little Mrs. Beon corners of our own community. I

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000
think this would be a very great country and then one.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
To organize.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000
To act to pretend

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000
that we are the government.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000
Doesn't mean that.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000
Well we are supposed to be of course in a democracy but to

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
to do those things which we want the governments to do and we

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
want which we want other people to do and by

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000
example therefore to lead both the

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000
government and other groups of people. To act in the same

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.000
way to set up. Perhaps

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000
parallel

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000
institutions where existing institutions don't do what we want the freedom school idea

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
for instance a marvelous idea to set up a school in

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
a community. Where you bring Negroes and whites together in a way that

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
are not brought together in the ordinary

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000
school to create little yardsticks as the T.V. A was to

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
the power in the street a little

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000
examples in schools in housing and social life.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000
In every way we can to bring begin to break out of the

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.000
professional specializations in which we are all involved and.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000
To become human beings first and lawyers second teachers

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
second journalists.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.000

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000
