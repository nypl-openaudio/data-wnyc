Patricia Marx interviews each week at this time your city station brings you an interview with a leading

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
figure in the arts politics or the sciences and here now to introduce today's

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
program is Patricia

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
marks in the next generation Americans will bill as much that we have in our

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
entire history the equivalent of a whole new Chicago each year and by the

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
end of the century eighty percent of our people will be living and dying in the

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
cities. And alighted to have as my guest today in the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
battle crusader for better cities the distinguished architecture critic for The

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Washington Post was fun

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Eckart Mr Bonaparte has just written a provocative book about modern architecture

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and city planning in title a place to live the crisis of the city's.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
This is on a cart. Throughout your book you use the phrase a sense of place.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
What do you mean by that it's not entirely easy to

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
define

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
this market. Perhaps you could substitute

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
this phrase in a way by saying this is a place where I feel at

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
home and I think you and I very often get this feeling

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
of feeling at home even in places that we've never seen before it's it's

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
it's a sort of a visual

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
experience of going somewhere and feeling here. I fit in I belong.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I can't. I am somebody. This could be a very all over

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
all mine our.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Place is really such as the square Bernini's columns in front of

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
St Peter's which is certainly not Causey's in the sense that you know you feel causally

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
that that's where you're live but yet you feel.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
If you're so inclined it's not the same thing for everybody that

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
that. You know here is something that this is an expression of a

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
civilization an expression of an ambition and expression of the spirit that I share that

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
means something to me. Or it could be just

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
a very innocuous little pop or small apartment of a friend that

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
you come in and you feel you know it's this is this where thing in other

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
words it

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
is the kind of of environment that has

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
a personal relationship to the individual to where

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
you feel you belong. You know and there are lots

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
of environments where you feel you do not belong which are non-image which are driving you to being

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
very hectic or you don't feel you're being way about them but if you

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
lost. The criterion. You used to judge whether Abilene is

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
good architecture whether a city's well planned. I think

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
it is I think does it have meaning to people not does it have meaning in

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
terms of its profits that it makes you know as

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
successful not does it have meaning purely in terms of efficiency in other words is the air

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
conditioning working writers that warm or hot or something is does it have meaning that have appeal

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
to the individual to to our souls who are

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
spirit. There are cities that be feel attracted

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
to the cities of if you were repelled by.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And I think this is a quality that can be that. That in

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
the past as it has grown. It's it's you

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
know cumulated over the ages but I think it's a kind of quality that can also be created. You know we're

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
a bit. Too many city planners today the words

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
beautification good design are almost dirty words and they feel

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
that with the pressing and urgent needs for a decent housing for

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
more schools that concern for statics is really a luxury that can't be that we

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
can't afford. Can we afford to do wary about a sense of place.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
I think we can we cannot afford not to forward

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
because this is the essence the

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
essence is not just merely to provide shelter after all we have to. Even for our

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
poorest niggers in Harlem we have some manner of shelter.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
This is not the point it's very poor shelter in there lots of rats there but the point

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
that alienates him from our society and that makes him very mad and drives him to the

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
point of riots is a sense of alienation and frustration and so forth this because even the

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
best quote decent safe and sanitary housing does not have

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
this sense of place is this give them a feeling feeling of

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
belonging it's not just a matter of of pure efficiency.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Again I think it's just her bank to say that good design is

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
unimportant just as Lancy design

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
anything. I think it's utter bunk to say the beautification is nonsense

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
that ask any woman about beautification she knows who she puts on the lipstick and makes her feel

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
better and therefore she's more attractive to the men at the Something to

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
cosmetics. Let's not not the little Sure. Cosmetics isn't going to help

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
anybody with a bad

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
disease. You know cosmetics doesn't cure cancer but cosmetics is

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
a limited means to instill self confidence

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and and emphasize A good points in a woman's face and so forth so why can't we why shouldn't

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
we emphasize a good point in the city by planting more trees and so forth but that's not the main point.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
The main point is that that. Because we are so

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
frustrated in our our efforts to bring order and

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
decency social decency and social justice included into our environment

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
we say these things don't count anymore. Anymore let's have pop let's have jazz that's have you know.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
This isn't what matters it doesn't matter. Think the very old

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
fashioned if you want to call it that virtues of having order

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
and decency and human appeal in the place in which we live are

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
her the real important

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
things you say in your book a place to live that modern architecture has failed.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
You see it's lost its direction. What direction do you think it should take.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
The direction of social awareness. The the direction that or

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
the recognition that sculpture is sculpture and

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
art is art and architecture is an even greater and more important art because it is a social

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
art because we have to do something for people.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
And this doing something for people is not limited merely again to the efficiency of having

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
the right kind of air conditioning and the right kind

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
of of a proper work functioning

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and the mitten necessary number of of elevators

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and functional appeal but it is it's this

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
human element of

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000
of giving people a sense that it's worthwhile living on this earth.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
That's what architecture does it's

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
shelter as you remember having read the book start out way back

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
you know with caveman when he crawled into the cave there was this

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
instinctual feeling that he had to take possession of this cave by scribbling things on

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
the wall by giving it part of his identity and then the cave gives its identity back

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
to him because it's his cave now he is cave man he's not just another creature he has given man. Why

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
because this cave has an identity due to the murals that he painted on the

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
walls. Now we lost this sense of identity in our place to

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
live because we're not giving it and sufficient the of ourselves and

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
therefore the place be it an apartment or being at home or be

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
a a neighborhood or be a whole city doesn't give anything back to

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
us you travel around. In this country and as I do

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
and you wake up in the morning the otel you take Sean you go downstairs

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and you forget where you are.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
You don't know why very often literally don't quite know.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Looking down the main street out of my hotel or mine Cleveland and Buffalo are where they all look alike.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
It's no identity there's no sense of belonging. This wouldn't happen to you in. Then assign roam

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
around and shop. You know which still

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
hasn't this been a car that like to explore the reasons you give for the failure of modern

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
architecture and the first reason you state is that its failure to

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
harness modern

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
technology when when you look at things like But SR Fuller's geodesic domes in

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
the skyscrapers the steel and glass and. Some of the shell

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
structures sound in buildings it looks as if technology is being used. What more do you think could be

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000
done through

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
technology or whole or more it's been done we haven't tapped acknowledge to yet. I mean

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
that's what you just said. Buckminster Fuller has has

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
created these wonderful bubble domes and they have absolutely no relation to our daily

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
existence except to make nice exhibit pavilions but he's a great friend of mine but this

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
is just no rebel relevance to our place to live so OK And then we

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
have the glass skyscrapers and look technological as all get

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
out but they really aren't they a log cabin instead of logs you use glass it's all a

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
there's there's no application if you look at at.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
What we've been able to do in so many many other fields of mass production

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
television sets and automobiles and so forth which is gotten as you know no ways

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
of getting about for ever Loring price you know the cost of living goes

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
up but the forget that our telephone bill is really coming down all the time. This is

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
what automation and technology is able to do for us but they're not doing it

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
in architecture the price of houses is constantly going

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
up and we are building in these antiquated old methods watch

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
them even build a skyscraper. And you know here this lot men putting

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
up a post and then they put a beam across and it's the

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
same with a built in Egypt. So we haven't

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
tapped mass production techniques automation and so forth to do this

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
thing fast at the scale that you need to do

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
it but if you argue for greater individuality in a sense of identity a sense of place. How

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
can you at the same time argue for greater mass production and less

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
individuality very good question and a very important question. But I've been

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
tainted that you can produce the building component the

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
model in such a way that you can do all sorts of applications for

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
I mean look at give you a practical example I think the right step in that direction is habitat at the

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Montreal fair which most of us the scene here fifteen different kinds of

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
houses essentially these houses in the skies have been created out of the same model

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
a box of this is is pulled out of the shed by mass production method

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
good design that's can take components standardized doors

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
standardized this and the other thing and put it together in a way that suits people and and and

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
does cater to their individuality. So we have to make the

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
difference between cookie stand. You know. Cookie method what do you call this

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
thing and stamp out little houses all look a lot like

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
houses which doesn't work as we know makes it all terribly monotonous and

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
getting down to basic techniques of building with which we could do

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
a hell of a lot more than what we're doing now with old fashion

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
that you see prefabrication as a means of bringing

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
about better housing and also better

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
design not prefabrication of total houses prefabrication of building

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
components today. If it's even in these very

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
advanced technological looking glass

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
boxes you still have to fit each individual door in the in the catalog

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
that architects work with which is called Suite catalogs there are about four hundred and seventy five

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
different sizes and things doors this could be reduced to thirty and you could order them from the factory.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
You know and do it much cheaper. Cheaper that way and still have a lot of

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
individuality depending on the placement depending on how you paint them so forth you know that's keeping this

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000
from being done.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
What's keeping it from being done. Is is that in contrast to most other industries

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
which have sort of consolidated into large corporations the building industry and

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
the corresponding building trade unions until still terribly

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
fragmented most of the building that's been done in this country is done by a

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
little small time builders who build three or four houses a year and therefore don't

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
have the resources to go into into research and development. They

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:26.000
don't have

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
the you know the means and the wherewithal for or

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
for rationalizing and industrializing building techniques and until we

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
get big business into the building and housing game. They're not going

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
to get any worse.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
The second major reason you give for the Set your mind architecture is to say you to provide historic

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
um nudie I wonder if you could explain what you would see importance of that is what you

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000
mean by that.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Well it's its familiarity I think again to to.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
What we greatly admired about his double bubble gum Swinson Buckminster Fuller's

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:04.000
for

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
those Republicans who are greatly admire some way out pop art when we go to the museum and

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
we wouldn't want to have in our room or in our home. You know what we want to have in our home is

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
something that is is as familiar we like to have the feeling that we are part of the human race but

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:19.000
is

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
that acknowledge in our furniture in our in the paintings we hang on

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
the wall and the things that you surround ourselves with we are not

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
just the first man on earth but that we are the sons and daughters of our parents in the in terms

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
of the sons and daughters of their parents and that there is this human continuity.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
You know that didn't. Didn't all happen that once was arson the whole burden of history has

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:43.000
on

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
our is on our shoulders that way and this sense of

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000
of continuity of being part of the mainstream of

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000
natural life and human

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
life is broken by the ambition of architects to be.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Gentle every time they design something for us. They want to do something the criterion today of whether

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
it's good or bad is not really is it good or bad is it original is it new is it something totally brand

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000
new and this is what these people are obsessed with and this is what alienates us because we don't want to

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
be original all the time we want to be our good sweet old

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
selves. You say finally that the these two faults of

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
combined to create a third which is the savior of modern architecture and design to gain

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
popular acceptance. Now I want them most twentieth century art

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000
is not as popular as

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
the classical and traditional art twelve tone

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
music abstract painting modern dance.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Theater of the absurd is never gained as much popular acceptance as

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:52.000
the old favorite traditional Masters now is this lack of thought to acceptance.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
The architect's fault or the people's fault.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
No I don't think it's a people fault. I think I'm going on the assumption that the people

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
are pretty nice and and full of of good will and I think when

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
you say that modern art has not been mixing the other aspects of modern art have not eggs

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
been accepted you singled out the more

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
experimental aspects of modern art twelve

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000
tone tonal

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
music. I would say that Gershwin is radically modern in terms of

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
paid whole phenomenon don't know much about music and I don't want to fall into any kind of trap but Gershwin has

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
been tremendously popular. I think Kurt Weill has been tremendously popular. It's that kind

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
of experimentation that is still

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
strange to us which is different you cannot say that modern

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
art in its popular application

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
has been the kind of feeling that I think architecture it has. When you look at the

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:48.000
success

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
of the Montreal Expos in comparison to the to the

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
New York World's Fair because in all its visual appeals and the design in the kind

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000
of lettering they had.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
On the expo was extremely modern in the sense that

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
any and the very

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
advanced designer would acknowledge as a good piece of of good design and work in

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
my most advanced hand and it was a tremendous popular success.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
If you today tried to build. Even the builds a void

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
in

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Scarsdale the corpus years experimental bill of which he built nine hundred thirty

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
here thirty seven years later and still be a huge outcry nobody wanted to live in it so in

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
that sense that was a failure. The kind of graphics that they presented at Expo was a success.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000
The kind of music that Gershwin wrote was a success and I think in many other

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
things modern art has this for me it

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
permeated modern

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
life far more in in in in all other aspects music

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
painting and so on than it has been in the way we live. The main thing that

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
modern architecture when they started out the revolution modern architecture revolution

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
was Gropius and the core was your muse and so on wanted to do is what's this type of

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
thing that needs to be done. Which is to find the link between art and

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
technology to design a piece of furniture for instance or even design a house

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
in such a way that we can mass produce it. We can and yet make it individual

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
or individual is it not. And

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000
this really we have taught. The field that we are not mass producing

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
anything that we really want to live

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
with and yet when an architect is popular like a dural stone

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
and gets on the cover Time is kind of the American people's architect and certainly has captured

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
the imagination of the people of America you criticize

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
it.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Well because I don't think he has really he is he is.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Contributed to answer our problems the thing that Ed Stone and it's a

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
very earnest and hardworking man has done is

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000
that he's ingratiate.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Stuff is not a made himself popular appeal to our

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
our instincts or our searching for continuity and

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000
prettiness you know and cashed in on that and giving us is the sort of pretty

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
pretty pretty pretty as. Without

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000
really giving us what he is capable of doing

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000
advancing this bringing it for instance into the technological fold making the place a better place to live.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
He's done that before when he was still with the international standard need to build a museum of modern

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
art you know way back before it got pretty

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
pretty and it was a wonderful museum I was going to guess that it's great you know Philip

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Johnson added onto it and enhanced it for

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000
it but this sort of honest approach to

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000
giving society what it needs years to see can for taking the

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
shortcut of of pretty pretty in Gratiot

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
issues this event occurred. You say that modern architecture has failed

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
and then you go on to say that it's less important than

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
city planning and urban design and yet those are in a deplorable state and you

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:14.000
still go on to say that you're an optimist. Now how do you reconcile all those statements.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Modern architecture is really no longer very

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
important because what is important is the overall divine environment when we can live within the house

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
and apartment but we cannot live when we get out in the street so we have to do something about the

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
street modern city planning isn't doing

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
enough about the street keeping automobiles the way in solving that problem

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
for instance and the problem for air pollution so I see that planet where planning is a more

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
far more important thing than the individual building it hasn't really done its

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:43.000
bit

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000
yet and and hasn't gotten anywhere so

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
far are when I say I'm optimistic. It's

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
because we're beginning to realise what the real problem

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
is we're beginning to realise that the real problem is one that. Application

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
of real technology to the problem.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
It is the realization that something is desperately wrong was on

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
our environment.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000
And the people in the ghetto has helped us realize that by just exploding boom and having these minds

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000
and open our eyes to the

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000
and livability of our cities and by seeing what by by having it

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000
rubbed into

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
our God knows us wrapped into what is is is wrong with society we are beginning to see what

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000
kind of city and what kind of life we do want which is as has is it

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
is a game and the stick approach it's not just who is going to make money whether

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.000
the

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000
the everything is going to pay for itself or

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
make big profits. But whether we are going to lose use our

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000
land and and our air and our rivers and our

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
resources to make a place in which we

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
can function properly and become creative people. So we don't need the

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
modern city of tomorrow.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
I don't think I think we need that like a hole in the head of a lot of big Mega Structures and we

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000
don't need a lot of other things but we need a city in which we can which we can take for

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000
granted in a way in which we can live a creative life and go on to the

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000
next

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
problem is to find a card. What are some of the tangible signs

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:29.000
of tangible causes for optimism but can you give some examples of good planning.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000
Yes I think we have some some very good examples of I mean good examples of good

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000
planning the easiest way to do good planning is for Chris to start from scratch out in

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
the open country when you start a new new

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000
town and I think. It's its main

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
aspects the new town of Reston Virginia is a

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
good environment and has been well platen it's a lake that is a way that

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000
people can congregate it's a way of getting to your shopping and for the way that children can. See their

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
friends without having to be driven by their mamas for two

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
hundred twenty five miles and and you know you can walk

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000
and and you can have I think the key to this is privacy

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
give people privacy and same time give them community when they want

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
it and this can be designed you know if you don't let the automobile interfere too much and

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000
so forth and I think this at this restaurant has succeeded I think Colombia is another new town

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
where building between Baltimore and

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Washington has taken the bugs out brings

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
all the advantages of suburbia and and reduced them the

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000
disadvantages of suburbia and I think we're beginning to see it in certain sections of the of the city where

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000
the planning is

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000
good what are some examples of in cities themselves.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000
Well I think you know there are different approaches to it and we haven't got a good total city but

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000
the approach to a real center city which is lively and

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000
and and symbol and you know draws people is

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Rockefeller Center and that was done thirty six years ago. It's marvelous everybody still goes even on

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000
Sundays when there are no shops and no real reason for God there. I think

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000
we've we're beginning to do this on a larger scale in

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Boston along around the the new City Hall the square there gives you a feeling

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
of this is Boston of identity and sense of

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000
belonging. I think some of the rehabilitation being done

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000
in Hyde Park in what and Chicago has some very very

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000
excellent aspects and I see there is a direction that we begin to see with

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
what it is we want to and many other

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
places do for the master plans for cities or are necessary or that there should be an approach

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
more community neighborhood by neighborhood.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000
Both I think in order to make a neighborhood function a neighborhood. You know no man is an island to

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000
himself and no neighborhood can function in isolation. You can't you can't get

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000
a good school. For instance which is essential to a neighborhood a good

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000
elementary school because before you know where the kids going to go when he gets into high school.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000
In order to plan anything in your own life or in the city. You always have to plan it in

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
the context of the next higher order. You know you cannot have a really

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000
efficient living room in your house unless your kitchen is also fish. You know the

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
obvious one thing this ecology of

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000
things so that you. The essential thing we must do is to plan good neighborhoods neighborhoods that

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
are really neighborhoods in which

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000
we have the sense of loyalty to and in which people behave and feel at home and

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
also have their privacy but you can't plan good neighborhoods and unless you have a master plan for

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000
the overall city to see how this neighborhood relates to everything

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000
else and you can't really have a good city until your plan the whole region because everything is dependent

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.000
on the economics of the transportation system on the on the Where do you get your

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.000
water from where is the industry and where do people go for recreation This cannot be

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000
handled within the city. We have to have

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000
regional how are we going to get. I don't think we are going to get it by

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
just admonition and saying how awful everything

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000
is I think we get it partly by defining the problem what is it

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000
that we're really after and I would say this is the sort of and humanistic approach to the

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000
environment and and and then we look back and see how did pop

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Sixtus

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000
really bring about the urban renewal in Rome and how did Housman make Paris a

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000
better city. It was always linked to a

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000
political ideological in goal. And to some sort of

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
political movement that wanted to get

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000
action either by maintaining a status quo like the Pope or

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
by social reform like the Fabian support the new towns into England and so

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000
forth so I think the only way we're going to get any worse in this country is that

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000
the idea or heights and political movements in this country by the liberals

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000
and the civil rights movements on begin to. The

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000
the importance of environmental problems to social.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000
And linked themselves to a real national program to build good

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000
cities and this is going to be done with political candidates and in the arena and

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000
the reason we haven't had it in this country is because the planners thought they could stay low from

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000
politics and from the practical dirty business of debating things and compromising all that.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
