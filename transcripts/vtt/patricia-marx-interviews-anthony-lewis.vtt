00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm delighted to have as my guest today Mr Anthony Lewis who has been head of the

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
London bureau of The New York Times since December nine hundred sixty

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
four previously Mr Lewis reporter for the Washington

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
bureau where he won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Supreme Court. He has

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
written a book entitled Gideon's trumpet about a great case in the Supreme Court

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and most recently a book about the struggle for civil rights entitled portrait of

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
a decade.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Mr Lewis you've written a great deal about the impact of the law on American

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
society does the law apply you similarly active role in

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
England not a top. That's one of the disappointing things to me I guess that I care so much about the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
law in the law in this country is.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
A much more marginal affair for historic reasons

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
that lawyers and judges just do not want to involve themselves in the kind of social

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
moral political questions that American judges and particularly the Supreme Court

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
just naturally deals with it's unthinkable in this country that judges would take it on

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
themselves to decide on national

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
policy on racial discrimination not say or. More

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
recent subject subject that judges

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
would ensure the fairness of political district

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
ing for election of Representatives those subjects are for historical

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
reasons have been put aside for Parliament to decide and it's just tradition if you try

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
to bring a case with that kind of Marler

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
political overtone a case in which judges are asked to pass on a basic social question.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
They will say we're sorry take that to

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Parliament with the actually have the power to pass judgment. They just

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
decide not to don't they have the power it so

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
well of course judges can always do anything they want the question is whether they'll be overruled and the answer is they would

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
be overruled and that's so in a sense they don't have the power.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
What's happened is the interplay of the courts in Parliament. The courts discovered that when

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
they did things parliament quickly overrule them and Parliament in this country has the ultimate

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
power unlike the United States where the court speaks with the voice of the Constitution. There is no

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
written constitution

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
here. So whatever the court says Parliament can undo the next day just as it wishes by a

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
simple vote. The judges have perhaps out of a sense of

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
self-preservation made a point of not doing things that

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
they thought parliament would change.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Partly this comes out of a period when courts were very

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
conservative and when for example they did things that restricted the rights of

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
trade unions to strike and to demonstrate and do other things they want to do this was just at the

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
time when the Labor Party was being formed in this country was

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
emerging and the actions of the courts were much resented and legislation was passed

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
on do what the courts had

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
said.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And that left a permanent mark court's just Although now

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.000
on the

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
whole anything the courts did in the way of what we would regard as social questions would be on

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
the progressive side because the law's so backward in this country and all sorts of questions

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
that that any change would be you know really on the progressive side and

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
yet the hangover of distrust for courts and judges prevents any action at

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
all can you give a specific when you say the law is so backward in so many ways.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
What would be an example of

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
this or there was a case just

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
handed down. In which

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
the Court of Appeal held in line with

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
precedence or quite old that a barrister barristers

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
the branch of the legal

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
profession a member of the branch of the lever fashion that appears in

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
court sees a courtroom lawyer wears a wig. And

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
again the barrister could not be sued for

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
negligence this is it has lots

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
of reasons most people think it's a. Heard you can sue anybody else for negligence you consider a doctor

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
who conducts a bad operation you can sue an accountant who cooks your books you can't sue a lawyer

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
who mangles your

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
case why because some judge said that a couple hundred years ago in the court of appeals said well you

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
know we don't want to change now there's an immense respect for precedent much more than

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
in the United States and a kind of frozen condition of the law as a result.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
On the theory in my view as an American

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
I have to add to be fair and completely erroneous there e that

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
parliament will correct the flaws that if the law's out of date that parliament will bring it

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
up today that it by I say is phony because Parliament doesn't have time to worry about the

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
law Parliament's time is completely film sets. Day and

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
night doing the political things that Mr Wilson wants to get

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
through it rarely devotes any attention to the law at all.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
What is it true that until just recently the court could not even

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
reverse its own decisions from centuries gone by that it

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
only recently has the power to change its mind.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
The House of Lords which is one of the peculiar institutions in this country in which that's partly

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
as a legislative body body but also sets as the highest court of Britain.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Although it's I interjected all oh it's called the House of Lords all members of the House of Lords

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
do not in practice sit as judges but only a half dozen people appointed

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Lords specifically to be judges until last year

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
the House of Lords took the view that it could never change its mind. IT'S IT'S IT'S ALMOST

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
KILLED Bertie and it's so

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
fantastic some majority fifty or a hundred years ago decided some point which

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
now the judges would readily admit was perfectly absurd and yet they

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000
say we can't change our mind once we've said that black is white it must always be white.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Well it's year quite to everybody surprise and it is perhaps a hopeful sign the court in all it's not.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Just say a gnat's that was no longer true and that from now on when they thought a prior

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
decision was erroneous they would feel free to overrule it.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
I may add as a sign of the conservatism of the profession in this country not just of the

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
judges but much more significantly of the legal

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
profession that when that announcement was made the chairman of the Bar Council or

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
the secretary in any case one of the figures on the Bar Council issued a statement saying that

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
he questioned whether the court had the power to change its mind about changing

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
its mind without being authorized to do so by parliament they are very cautious and

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
days as this Jane had any effect in the news as it borne any

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000
fruit so

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
far none whatsoever they have not actually overruled any prior case yet and it's clear that at

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000
least the beginning they're going

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
to do so very seldom because as I say lawyers are very

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
conservative Parliament is very sensitive of its power and of the House of Lords began overruling

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
cases wholesale there'd be a lot of noses out of

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
joint in June one thousand nine hundred eighty five the government passed a law

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Commission Act which was to study and reform the law. Have there been

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
any results benefits results from

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
this and there have been some preliminary results of course it's too soon to expect very

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
much the Law Commission Act and the whole idea

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:24.000
of law reform indicates that again the conservatism of the profession.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
The act was an answer to the very process of stultification of which I have spoken

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
the fact that over the centuries regard for precedent has been so

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
strong that old irrelevant decisions have been allowed to accumulate unnoticed and

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:39.000
no changes made

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
in Lord Gardner When he was who is now Lord Chancellor when he

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
was a private lawyer campaign for law reform through a commission and

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
he won money but when Labor came into power he was made Lord Chancellor and he pushed through the Law

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Commission Act Now there are these commissions that can propose reforms in the law changes in the

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
law. Which come before Parliament but in a rather routine way so

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
that it doesn't take a lot

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
of time which is the precious commodity in parliament but and here's the but it's a good idea I'm all

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
for it I think it's fine and overdue but the view of the legal

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
profession is that lease. But the law commissions in various The Law

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Commission and its committees in various

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
fields can really only deal with what would we call lawyers law technical

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
points of procedure.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Does this also mean then that the findings of psychology and sociology

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and kind of disciplines are beginning to influence judge

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
legal judgments in the states have no bearing on the

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
legal tradition here.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
No is an awfully strong word but if there's any bearing it's invisible to the naked eye let's put it

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
that way I will add that not only are there very seldom any references to

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
the disciplines you've just mentioned but under the practice in British

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
courts in this is to me one of the most remarkable things when

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
a British court passes on the meaning of a statute passed by parliament.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Now the statute is passed and

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
it usually has like American statutes is written rather barely And it's kind of hard to tell what the

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
words mean when it's applied to a specific

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
case. British courts are forbidden to look into the debates of

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Parliament to try to find out what the words may mean there they are not allowed to

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
use legislative history which is of course the absolute most basic thing that every American court

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
does to find out the meaning of the statute because that would give the courts in their

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
view too much freeplay they must only look at the printed words of the

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
statute book. There seems to be more and more concern about this

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
expressed Do you think there is a prospect of change in the near

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.000
future five or ten you change in the legal profession.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
I would almost say ask Charles Dickens I mean he has. Yes I think there is some.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Change government coming there are rumblings but it is still

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
an intensely conservative profession I think if it's going to be

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
changed probably wholesale I mean radical

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
reform such as the amalgamation of the two branches of the profession solicitors and barristers into one profession

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
as we have it which would be a real impulse for a change of attitude in the profession

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:20.000
more

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
modern that kind of thing I think can only come not from the lawyers and selves. But can

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
only come from perhaps an outside Royal Commission which would investigate and propose

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
the Economist the very good Weekly magazine has proposed a royal

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
commission with a large element of non lawyers for that very reason.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Could you explain the difference between solicitors and

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
barristers solicitors are the office lawyers just sort of

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
ordinary chaps who sit in their office and when you have a problem you go to a solicitor.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
They helped draft your contract or you will

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000
or somebody sues you you go to a solicitor and you talk to him

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
then there are these elevated people socially as well

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
as in other ways elevated by tradition barristers barristers

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
are as I say regarded as rather high falutin solicitors

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
or grubby chaps who sit in an office barristers who wear wigs and gowns

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000
and appear in court.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
There are only two thousand of them there are very small clubby group in England and they practically all

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
know each other.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
When you have something you have to go into court. Your solicitor. Goes to

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
a barrister The mere client is not ever allowed to approach this exalted

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
figure your solicitor must choose a barrister and ask him whether he plays would be kind enough

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000
to take your case in

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
the court. You stated restated that the law is is

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
extremely conservative here. The whole legal profession. What do you think the reasons are for this.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Perhaps it's partly the division in the profession. The fact that the trends have always

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
been set by the barristers because of. Because everyone regards them as

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
they leave. Figures these elevated types as I say and because at least

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
until recently they have by definition of had to be rich upper class

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
people and that was because you didn't earn

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
anything as a barrister you literally are not a penny for five or six years after you began

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
practicing you just went into court and watched other people and you never got a brief yourself so

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
you couldn't do it unless you came in with a lot of money.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Now they have legal aid that is the state provides lawyers for poor people

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
in both civil and criminal cases a lot of those legal aid breaks are going to young

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
barrister so that you can make a kind of bare living at the beginning. Perhaps that will be a change

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
to bring some lower class less establishment figures

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
in the main reason however I think is the system of legal education which is

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000
again amazing.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
You don't have to have gone to college at all to be a lawyer in Britain

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
much less law school I don't have graduate law schools.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
AT ALL You may go to a university if you do you will get

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
some special legal training as an

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
undergraduate but mainly you come to London and you eat dinners. You literally you go

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
to an in one of the legal ends of the temple and you sit in a great hall

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
and you eat dinners where you're supposed to imbibe a lot bias talking to

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
your to your elders and you're tutored in specific subjects

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
for example you have a tutor on contracts who could tell you what the law of

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
contracts was at some length and then you pass an exam and if you can pass your exam

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
and contracts in the

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
subject and have eaten the requisite number of dinners which is very important you. I mean

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
that when you're called to the bar.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Well the difficulty with that is that it wholly omits the searching

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
mind open opening quality of an American law school where instead of just being told what the law

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
of contracts is you spend your time debating the rightness or wrongness of judicial

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
decisions the case method then you find out there isn't exactly a right or

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
wrong it's a process it's a way of. Thinking and American law schools at

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
least good ones and there are quite a few good ones really do shake you up

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
at their best not that American lawyers are conservative many of them

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
are but it is a much more open minded profession I think than here partly

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
because people have come from this closed system of legal education with

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
no sense of challenge in an American law school a student is expected to

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
side of the professor I think you're all wrong I think that judge was just crazy and I've never seen a worse

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
decision in my life. That's just not on the cards

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
here Mr Lewis you deserve very closely both the American and

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
English democracies at work and I wonder what you feel are the the most significant

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
differences between the two systems.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
But it's a paradoxical difference I think.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
In this country the House of Commons by tradition and practice

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000
is the focus of very much that goes on public statements are always made by

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
the prime minister or other ministers in the House of Commons Not always but almost always important

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
public statements they don't have press

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
conferences big events happen in the House of Commons. There

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
is no sense of the separation of the presidency that we have in which

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
the real focus in Washington is on Lyndon B. Johnson and Congress is just something

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000
else but the paradox is that the House of Commons in this country has no power and

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Congress has lots of

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
power relatively speaking. And you can examine that

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000
in terms that say of Senator

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Fulbright who can hold a committee hearing. Not that he can really push a button and make the

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
bomb go off and have power in that sense but he can bother the president an awful lot. He can

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
hold a committee hearing can call Secretary McNamara Secretary Rusk.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Put propositions to them make them defend their Vietnam

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
policy a separate political personalities can arise in

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Congress like Robert Kennedy say in the Senate arise and have a

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000
political dimension all. Zone apart from the government or the official opposition those

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
things don't happen in this country House of Commons has

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
no committees that can could has one or two committees of a minor character has no committees that have

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000
the power to call anybody from the government nobody from the government ever appears before a committee and that

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:16.000
become

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
common the foreign secretary never is asked a

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
question by a committee to defend his policy he is asked the substitute is

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000
this process of Question

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Time in the House of Commons which is infrequent brief uninformed not the

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.000
it can't be that only fifteen minutes you know that kind of thing and the questions have to be put down weeks ahead.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
There isn't this real process in a committee room of having the questions that are

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
that day's questions pressed on relentlessly

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
of secretary of defense saying.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
And because of the party system in this country. The fact

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
that you must vote with your party that you don't have the freedom that you do as a senator or congressman really

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000
to vote as you

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
will the government has an absolute whip hand the government says we

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
have a bill here it is it's going to pass and it does pass government has a majority

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
of ninety five now any billet it puts up is going to pass this just no

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000
question about

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000
it literally this is like a rubber stamp it is like a rubber stamp the

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Commons does provide a forum that's very interesting but when the when the issue

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
comes to a head a government is always going to prevail and it's going to prevail short of some

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
catastrophe I mean if the pound falls.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
If something like that happens then presumably the whole party system may break down and fifty members

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
of the Labor Party may say we don't like Harold Wilson and we just can't stand it anymore we're going

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000
to get out of the Labor Party but the price is getting out of the Labor Party because if you don't

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
vote with him and you do that persistently you're

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
out where does any significant debate take place if there is such

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000
a that's a very interesting question because. It takes place within the

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
government within the cabinet particularly. And here again it is much

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
more concealed from view than in the United States because the press is a

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
supine figure in this country.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000
Reporters for reasons I don't fully understand just hardly ever dig behind the

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
facade the government puts up and you very rarely have any sense of

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
the controversy within government about policy which you often do in the United States and

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
for example you know

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
American newspapers reported odd nauseum that George Ball when he

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
was undersecretary of state took a different view from the secretary on Vietnam and on Europe and

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000
those issues were fully

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
explored. Nobody in this country would ever dream of reporting that somebody within

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000
the government took a different view from someone else. I put that to strongly. Yes they do occasionally

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
reported but it's the unusual thing the debates take place all behind closed

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
doors to give a dramatic

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
example you know tax proposals in the United States particularly for radical reforms

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000
and tax

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
law are proposed by the president or the secretary of the Treasury they

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000
have lengthy hearings I mean months often in the House Ways and Means Committee public

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
hearings people testified.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Long debate passes the House debate in the Senate Finance Committee debate

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
on the floor of the Senate. Back and forth with Treasury Representatives finally it passes or it doesn't

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
pass in this country. The chancellor puts down a budget. There are no hints

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000
before it's a regarded as the world's greatest violation of secrecy indeed grounds for

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
for being thrown out of the government as has actually happened if there's any link on what

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
policy he's considering which of course they would be in the United States over months they'd be say well we

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
have this tax for that

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000
tax. He puts down his budget the same day

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000
with about an hour's debate the House of Commons by a party line

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
vote writes the tax into law and it becomes

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
it's collectible as of that

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
date then they go on and have a further long debate about making a permanent part of law.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Where the government majority of ninety five Of course it always will be passed in the end but there are no

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
committee hearings.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
No member of the public ever testifies etc It's

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.000
amazing what you do it is a great deal of talk in England about reforming the parliament.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
What do you think will be the substance and results of this.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000
I'm a bit cynical on that to if I were Prime Minister I wouldn't want to change it and I don't

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
think any prime minister when he's in office no matter how much he's talked about reform when he was in opposition

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
is actually going to do anything very

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
radical Now it's true that there is a reformist leader of the House of Commons now

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Richard Crossman and he will doubtless do some things I think one thing they may do is

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000
to introduce television cameras which would be interesting I think on the whole I'd be for that

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000
when members of the

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:53.000
public see how much time Parliament Rice on schoolboy jokes that might change.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000
I think that would be healthy although I'd hate to lose the schoolboy jokes altogether.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
But the really radical change would be the creation of committees with power

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000
to call ministers before them and power to ask them questions and require answers and

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
I'm skeptical that that will ever happen.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Many people at home look to him and as an example that we should

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
emulate in terms of social social welfare social

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000
legislation national health plan economy. What do you feel we have

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:24.000
to learn from

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
England but I wouldn't think if I may say so with great love of this country which

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000
I

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
have I do love Britain. I wouldn't think the planned economy was something that.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
Showed any signs of needing emulation at the moment when you see the state of the British economy

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
unemployment increasing investment down really a very bad way. I

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
think there is something to be learned learn from the social

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000
side which we have begun to learn with the Medicare program I personally

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000
find the National Health Service a very desirable thing I

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
think it has faults doctors are under.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Hey there aren't enough hospitals. Those are the four false of lack of resources this

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000
country just doesn't have the resources that the United States has doesn't have the money.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000
But in terms of equity and convenience and fairness I think the National Health

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Service works extremely well I go to a doctor I don't make an

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
appointment ahead. I go to the surgery as I call it. If I'm

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
sick and I wait if there are other people but I on the

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000
whole find that I wait. Not more but less than I did when I had an appointment with a doctor in the

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000
United States because appointments for the

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.000
mythical you go in you're treated in turn a very fair

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
good system and no charge of cost of course just the the charge

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
that you pay as a regular social costs like Social Security and doctors come to your

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
home also. I may add which is

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000
unusual in the United States or the other other areas because National Health is the one

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
that has heard of most of the other areas that you feel are

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000
then relation to United States social areas.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000
Well I I don't know I think the British would say yes as to for

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000
example housing. I have my doubts all of Britain has a

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000
very government subsidized a highly

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
subsidized housing program which the government builds houses and rents them for much less money than

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000
they cost.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000
I myself am in doubt that in the end that produces social good because the

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000
result of that has been to not build enough houses. It's true that in the United

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
States we have an inadequate number of houses built for poor or

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:37.000
middle class

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
people but on the whole I think that

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
the depressing effect on actual construction is self defeating

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000
the necessity of always building things at at a cost which you don't recover

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.000
the result of that is because of the lack of resources in the government that you just don't build

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000
houses. So you know I'm I'm I'm not terribly in through. He

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:00.000
asked

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000
about other aspects of the social system that may be just a lack of resources

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000
and I'm speaking of there are good kindergartens there are good provisions for daycare.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000
There are good things caring for children I think on the whole of that at least.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000
The bigger cities of the United States have done the same sorts of

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000
things. To lose we've been talking a good deal about

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000
what's wrong with various parts of English law and government.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000
What how is the quality of life in London or is it a depressing is

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
as the content of our conversation isn't up to them.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000
I'm afraid I've been somewhat misleading in that respect. You've asked me questions on

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000
subjects about which I'm

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000
critical but the fact is that the quality of life here is very good and maybe the

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000
lesson of it is that things that bumble along aren't very effective

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000
may not always be so bad I'm I'm reminded of American friend of mine who lives in

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000
this in the square in

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000
Chelsea and he was interviewed by somebody in a British

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000
magazine what do you think about British life and he railed on about how inefficient it was and how they had to

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000
tone up and get moving and so

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000
on and then he looked out of the window of his house and he said Look at that square look at all that park

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000
in the middle that wasted space in all those low

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000
houses. This is not shocking said I'll tell you the day that they fell it all up

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000
with skyscrapers I'm leaving. And that's the thing about life here the

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
paces is slower. The landscape that is this the City of

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000
London

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000
has much more contemplate of air low buildings parks

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000
and not with the jam and dirt and noise of New York and I may say

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000
that I prefer it very much.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000
Last summer. You wrote a piece in The New York Times about physiology in Britain. You

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000
said the atmosphere London today can be almost eerie in its quality relentless

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
for volatile. Do you stand by that because it causes enormous controversy when you wrote this.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000
Do you still think this is

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000
true I think I stand by it at the time I was feeling

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.000
very strongly the a sense of separation between two things one was

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000
the surface pleasures of London which are very great because the theatre

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
and music and dance and people close are they

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000
really wonderful and very gay. And I didn't mean to disapprove Marley I thought they

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000
were wonderful but I meant by. The airiness of

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000
it was that underneath I thought the country was heading for

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000
economic disaster Well it was five weeks after I wrote that piece that the economic crisis came on

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000
and we began the squeeze in the phrase and all these other things.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000
So I don't think on the whole I was wrong. What

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
I wish was that there was some way to translate. These wonderful qualities of living the gay a day

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000
the creativity the imagination and the

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000
youth because the youngness of life here is terribly important young people have a much more

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000
important role and they do in the United States in newspapers and magazines in the arts

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000
in theatre and so on some way to translate

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000
that. Drive into the economic side on

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000
the political side and give Britain the kind of leadership I think she needs.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000
Do you see any signs that you know months later the disses happening.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000
No thank you Mr

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Lewis you've been listening to Mr Anthony Lewis the putative Prize winning

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000
journalist who's been head of the New York Times bureau in London since December nine

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000
hundred sixty four. Thank you and good bye for now.
