00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
For centuries man has been speculating about the future but only recently has he begun

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to make systematic studies of the kinds of futures that he may choose for himself.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I'm delighted to have as my guest today the provokers of an original thinker

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Herman

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
can who is co-author of a book entitled The year two thousand a

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
framework for speculation on the next thirty three years. Mr Khan

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
is currently director of the Hudson Institute and also has written several other

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
controversial

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
books including on

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
escalation thinking about the UN thinkable and on the Duma nucular war.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
If you can I wonder if you begin by telling us a little bit about the Hudson Institute.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We're a nonprofit policy research organization. We work in the area of national security

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
international order public policy

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
generally how did you get involved in doing the study of the year two

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
thousand. Most of our work is future oriented five ten years

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
ahead and that's about all you can do seriously for the kinds of things we do.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
We just thought we would take a flyer looking at thirty three years. And this is done as much for fun

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
as serious.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Now it's turned out as we hope this word that many parts of the study are serious and

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
even more will be serious in the future.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
In what way are the serious what's serious

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
aspect of. The thing which is serious right now. Really has two aspects one we're

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
looking at right development problems and it turns out for development issues. A twenty to thirty

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
year perspective is exactly right. If you're trying to growth rate China change the graph of a

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
country from say two percent to three

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
percent and the birth rate from three percent to two percent that makes a two percent

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
difference now thirty five years that shows up as a factor of two in

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
the income per capita very impressive in ten years. It doesn't show

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
up very much so you must look this is

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
the roughly speaking you've got a Latin American president say something like this.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Anybody who says he can make you rich in a decade is a demagogue you just can't be

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
that rather surprisingly it can be done in thirty years. Why don't we get started.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Did you solve the new math and methodology to do this kind of study or is it just an extension

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
of the previous kind of skills and techniques.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Well basically all extensions of previous skills and

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
techniques the particular combination we use in the way we use is very

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
specialised or these parts from are. A good deal of the

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
material is. Normal projection forecasting that is you're looking

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
at ways of. Technology

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
changes there. The big difference what we do here that many organizations

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
do is we pay a lot of attention to the rate of innovation. So one most

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
important thing is not improvement of current technology but how rapidly new ideas come it.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
That's a very hard thing to be take because if you know what they were you'd be doing it. So trying to predict

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
the rate at which perfectly unknown ideas will come into the

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
system rather surprisingly you can do remarkably well on

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
it and we spend a lot of time and that type of thing.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
How can you judge what the likelihood of the reliability is for instance in your book you

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
did say that people that were forecasting if they done it at the turn of the century they

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
never would have predicted World War One Depression World War

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
two Einstein. How can you what degree

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
do you think it would be

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
reliable. Oh well you can't predict things like relativity

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
theory because that's a real change the nature of science. You can't put

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
a quantum mechanics that's a real change the nature of science. Once these things have come

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
in you may get some sense of the rate at which the new ideas will

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
be absorbed and you look at past examples get analogies if you

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
can do for the reliability of the study is

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
likely to be greater than thirty or sixty years ago.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Yeah I happen to believe that. The prediction the last of the twentieth century may be a lot easier for

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
many of the things that the first two thirds. Most important as basic picture of the world

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
as being well become. You can make a good analogy here. If you'd gone to

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
the Treaty of Vienna peace conference we had an eight hundred

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
fifteen and you asked the people there. What do you predict the next twenty five years. They almost

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I think invariably would have said the same as the last twenty five years revolutionary

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
violence sweeping Europe to keep it

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
down in fact the next hundred years or rather the peaceful You had eight hundred

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
thirty nine hundred forty eight but they were very violent and then the most interesting thing that occurred was the rise

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
of pressure has been totally overlooked. We have to think that Japan will pay the same role

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
again the rise of Japan may be one of most important events of the last third of the

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000
century and then of course after this hundred years it was probably one hundred fourteen.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Well the picture is very much of a kind of look rather lengthy period of relative calm.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Maybe the end of the century and then unless you use that time

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
well and it's hard to say what that

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
means very likely catechisms of the one nine hundred fourteen

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
so hopefully not as destructive. But potentiality of course they could be much

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
more recently present do mean nuclear holocaust.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
That's one of several times the things we tend to worry about

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
now and again there's a certain bias in our studies. If you

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
give human being societies enormous range of new potentiality as we're

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
getting abilities to really design things and new choices and new ways of doing

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
things and just enormously expanded possibilities. Your first of

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
the attitude is of course my God it will be a paradise. You know

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
everything your second attitude is offered but look at the many ways you can get the

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
travel where at the second level right now I hope you get back to the original

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
then but still there have many things you can do well but.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Really we tend to look at the difficulties you're getting into. And you can bust them and they're

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.000
just

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
enormous. Do you feel that the Policy Studies which is

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
one of the aims in this to avoid the difficulties is just essential.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
This is the hope. I mean now we do not yet take the serious enough to get that attitude.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
We're starting with really a three year program have these studies. I would hope within

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
the one hundred sixty eight to put out two more books on the medium long range future.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
then use the three books of the original book the year two thousand as a basis for

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
very serious systematic studies where we do a lot of outsiders sort of have to have the bucks now

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
to get the outside as deeply involved. As they want otherwise your visit here to go

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
away but by having a bus we have a shared understanding shared and adults

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
share theories shared metaphors. So we really hope to work with something new out

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000
of fifteen a couple hundred

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
people and do a very systematic series of studies on many aspects the

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
future when you speaking of the long list of problems. Most of

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
the many problems that we're very aware of like the threat of nuclear war obviously

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
the threat of population explosion in mass starvation id's

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
the magnitude of the problems are there new and different problems. Which is isolated.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
They tend to be somewhat there for the first look at war for example we tend to

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.000
say the world is stable or safer now than it was ten years ago and this can be helpful.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:32.000
On

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
the published explosion we would not be surprised it was not on the

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
reasonable control.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
This year the in years and have a very good harvest and I think the fears of many people had are

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
really mass starvation in the early seventy's is not

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
likely now that doesn't mean I myself was against the decision of the US government to cut back

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
on food production because they're afraid of food services now read rather starvation. I think it's better to

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
have the food services. As a hedge if things go

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000
badly. Why do you think you disagree with many other prognostications masterbation.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
They don't really disagree we just look at them I think some of them are carefully.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Let me make a fairly blunt

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
remark. Anybody who goes who gets up a platform as fast talking about

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
the population explosion. And that starvation. Tends to get a very

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
receptive audience people like to hear about this kind of calamity. Funny way they

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
really like to hear about it and it seems strange that the man on the platform looks like his

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
concerns. If something I guess I'm just not I think you're wrong but I don't know that you're

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
wrong but I think you're but you may be wrong fact I think the problems are rather high the now these issues will come

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
up but I can't be certain that man looks kind of cold.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
He looks like he doesn't care about people and is a lot stronger than that it looks like a

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000
dangerous statement because he cannot be certain now my own policy is let's look at what's most

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000
likely to

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
happen. But that's hedge against disaster. The US government policy was

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
the recent presidents. Presidential Commission. They looked at it and they said the chance

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
to like is we have a food surplus not a food shortage in the near

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
future and therefore they cut back on US production increase

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
controls now. I would've done the other way I would have said it's very possible we would not have any

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
food shortages that sort of increase of larger food anyway to

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
hedge and let us deal with the problem of price supports and the farmer issue in

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000
a different way.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Well if there is danger that this lack of the sense of urgency study such as

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
you made will actually contributed very

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
probably absolutely. Present one of the reasons why the population seems like

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
to be under control is because people overstated the problem. Now I don't know what to do

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000
about that they were in the business of trying to get these things as best we know how.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
And on most issues or we don't as what's the impact of our.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Buddy recently asked Is it the best we could do now it's

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
very difficult to move human beings. You want to kind of move them without overstating the issue.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
So there's obviously this you may do a rather important service and I go around the bombing people for

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
that reason I think never right I was there that they want.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
What are the areas we worry. And if we're asked. We simply give the best estimate we

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
have and we talk about the uncertainty and the points of hedging but that's less dramatic

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
than painting a fairly bleak

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
picture. One of the item is that you make in the book is

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
that contradict or deny the common belief

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
that poverty is the cause of disruptions in

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
instability throughout the world and you say that actually it's industrialization development and can

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
cause instability. Does this argue against giving economic aid

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
in industrial lising helping underdeveloped nations to

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
develop you know it argues against the common argument that I use many people when they

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
say the United States should help foreign

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
countries appeal to feelings of guilt shame

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
a fear they say you can't live with these hungry millions.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Now actually if you're a conservative senator or a conservative

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
congressman you won't mention it but you will think to yourself This man is telling me that all of

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
these millions of hungry people are mad at me hate me and I can buy a mop I

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
give him a few dollars. I'm smarter than that you know I know if I buy them up this way I got

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
madder at me which is

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
true and it's a very counterproductive kind of appeal but also it's bad for the A lot

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
of world this kind of appeal. To mean the basically helping other people

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
is that you're rich and they're poor and then either help you don't ask for help

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
you and furthermore there is a large

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
trend about transmitting ited States you can get money on this appeal.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
I've talked to many conservative congressman. Well you could do it this year in many years

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:56.000
they

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
agree if you can persuade them that this really helps receptive. They would love a very

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
large budget when that happens States and what I'm suggesting is we should really divide us

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
a program to two parts one part is done for the particle benefit United States. Here are part

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
of something better for the recipients and not for

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
us now in many cases the membership may in the short to medium and hurt the

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
United States. I don't care which we can live or that.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
You know. It's also very important to make these

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:27.000
comparisons

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
probably by and large very few members your audience will say. Feel as

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
he's got it on them as well as Rockefeller that he's in the neighborhood they know what they're like and so on

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
they compare themselves to their friends their relatives their father their past. This is true

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000
around the world.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Now if we're very successful say in Latin America we may double

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.000
the current Cross National part of our capital of say three hundred dollars so my six hundred or thousand.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
That's very impressive.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
We'll go to fifteen hundred that's even more impressive by the other century and the other hand it will be

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
only five to ten percent of the U.S. Gross National part of our capital.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
So it is true that America will think of these people being very poor generous actory from

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
their point of view they will be ten times as rich as their grandfathers

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000
five times richer their fathers.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Two or three times richer they are today. They have done very well they've done better than we were at

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
the turn of the century. Why should they be thought of as poor they don't make the compresses

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
we make the comparisons and force them on

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
them but they also make the comparison. Certainly in this country than eager to

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
make this very costly with a wife and it's neighbor

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
and it's mixed in with I'm sure he makes the

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000
comparison but these are the nigger the white compares the Rockefeller. Is a

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000
and even if I was I would do it I say they go to tell

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
me that the negroes worse off today than he was twenty years ago and I'll say why. Well his death

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
rate Negro baby just be three times out of white now is four times that of

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
white and actually that's a legal basis of an enormously. What they're

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000
saying almost as if the white baby should be killed them even up.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Biological the gap among young negroes and young whites is causing

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
today.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
People as far as I can see. The gap will still exist by then

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
the century probably will be substantially smaller but the more important thing is an exam self will be a

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
lot richer at the end of a century.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
You barely touch

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
race strife conflict considerable violence

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
and why isn't it seems such a Janet major issue

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000
facing all we know we have some discussion of it so I think you're right but we could

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
have more of one thing we're trying to study three years ahead and I suspect the

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
problem will have been largely not solved

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:55.000
but rationalized with. Let me give you a sort of likely prediction.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
You have a great deal more in a marriage most Negroes will be middle class in ten or twenty years back

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
more than half are now and the rest are rising very rapidly.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
So you have a situation you have a very large number say rough patches around say we have you know wanted

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
to by the end of the century we've got to replace this combination that we you

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
know tens of thousands of distinguished

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
negroes. And the least most of the country say half

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
the country say the liberal East and West Coast.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
You'll find that's the no discrimination. Maybe somebody in

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
this nation. And you'll find that at least at the rhetorical level.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000
It's actually a

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
lot on the other side actually founded many causes one for black power which will

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
give them a sense of pride does on the Greek side of these pathological sundries

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
very destructive a sense that they are their own masters that they have.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000
They're not depending on

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000
whitey and then those who decide to integrate the fact that by choice

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
that course is the only solution available to them. I think you saw a lot of these was the part

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
of the heat and these may well be sources of all kinds of

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
problems but the conscience which American are barristers these negroes

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000
who have largely been eliminated by the fact that you have these ten thousand mile punches.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Now I'm not saying it's a good or bad thing in fact this hurts the lower class Negro even

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
more because people say if these ten thousand people could

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
make it. And these fifteen million to make the middle class. Why could

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
you what would the standard of living in the year two thousand the lower class.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Look I would assume we will have a kind of a basic

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000
income of at the say fifteen hundred to two thousand dollars per

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
hour for one person with another say scores of thousand dollars per person. So that's

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
a husband and wife with three

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
children should be making about five thousand dollars or six thousand dollars. Now that's

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
very low in this century. It's good middle class income today in

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
the century to be the bottom ten percent of the

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000
population but you don't see it's a fairly optimistic view in this is you don't see a

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
backlash occurring on the part of the white community in separatism growing in violence growing.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
I think you have that for a time. I think a number of things which will never

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
get first and foremost the average niggling ited

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
States really does want to be declared and middle class. There are no. Very few hippies

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
and they don't want to drop out. Secondly that he

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000
was themselves have a kind of an ego backlash against the violence which is mostly

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000
all the negroes. The young negro said to be very much black power.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:40.000
But

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
I think that's also a fad. I think is a healthy fat. You know that is to think of it's

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:52.000
a very bad thing for man to deny his identity and it's because it has become problem cells.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Biologically these rights are not vicious very few white men of until

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
these riots and possible record say bullets. You know and I think that will

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:07.000
last for quite a while I think further there will be serious attempts but the riots down.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
The thing in a riot not in solving the basic underlying

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
problem but everybody the riot is quick reaction by the

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000
police and very firm reaction and some punishment afterwards.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000
So people understand that it is a serious matter to write it is not

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
a permissible allowable thing the and I think you're going to find that that's really

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
the start of the backlash. One of this issue heavy censors and very quick reaction.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000
I don't think you'd be

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
authoritarians the other side there are still be very many programs I think that help me grows.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Basically the Negro has to help themselves

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000
today and this in fact is one of things the Black Poppy will do do. Probably the

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000
most successful group in the world today are the black

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Muslims and by a large black nationalist groups. Tend to be very effective

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
in many cases not all in making the negro's of upwards.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000
That OF

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000
LAST your book you talk about post industrial societies and

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
essentially this is an affluent an abundance of

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
society and almost all the the age old dream of mankind freedom

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
from from want from starvation from drudgery. I realized and yet

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
you then talk about the growth in any nation in social pathology.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
This is indicate that when dreams are realize they turn him into nightmares.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
I think that's true if there are no new dreams. People really need

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
charisma they need a sense of excitement a sense of magic a sense of getting things done and

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
that everybody you know by and large I think you can have a very large middle class and

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
just live comfortably and recently

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:50.000
happily what we sometimes call the California barbecue culture or so hot something generous.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
You know it's wholesome but subset has a kind of the general aspect to it.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Percent of people though who really have to strive to solve problems. Do

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
exciting things to create and so on and if you take away most of

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
the really interesting challenges. These people lost.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:15.000
When you see if you have new dreams to use any anticipation of what those dreams.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
Well it's clear there are certain things are in the middle a lot of space research which is exciting for some

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
but doesn't really turn on was the Americans environmental

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
engineering that is really going to spend a lot of billions of dollars in this

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
country making the environment in the cities in the US the pleasant places to live. Now we're going

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000
to waste a lot of money it's already quite clear that we're making huge mistakes in every

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:43.000
development and we're doing something we have a tremendous compulsion to do more of the same.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
But that's what will that eventually will waste maybe fifty billion dollars but will learn

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
eventually. For issues that don't think America will get excited about environmental

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.000
engineering Europeans do they really love their cities and their parks and their rivers away which we

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
really don't think with the whole social engineering.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Remaking human beings the internal wreck sternal that is make the whole world into rich Americans whether they

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
like it or not.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Or do something about social pathology United

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
States. Both of these impulses can be dangerous.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
And I was very well I was just some people that get too excited about

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:24.000
the undersea water research is exciting for some people but most it's not.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Now the really

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
exciting think that they've won many people is a festival they call in a space. Looking internally.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
This can be mystic or die in the gym or spiritual or drugs or hippie.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:35.000
You

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
know and I expect a good deal of that but I

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
totally called you know I just don't like it. Well that's is a dead giveaway

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000
what's going to go on people are going to look for things that it's like. One of the ways to

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
get excited is to turn inward interpersonal

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
relationships many people believe their way out friends family relatives or

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
things like the sensitivity. Training

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
groups where you establish very quickly with other people and you use that

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
for all kinds of Turner purposes but I doubt. Again this will not affect the

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
majority Americans. But in the spectrum I know it's very

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.000
important if you're the things you mention are not the kind of charismatic dreams or

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
visions that avoid a sense of meaninglessness

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
your purpose was the central issue of the twenty first century will be meaning and

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000
purpose and we don't know how America will solve

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000
it now. One possibility is a return to the vision of a chapter meant the rest

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.000
are crap that if you spend a lot of time acquiring a very large number skills and things are very hard

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
to do with your choir very high level of capability. None of which are useful for.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
You in effect to prove

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000
yourself that you didn't characterize with a belief in progress or space in the future.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000
What is your own attitude towards the future.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Well I believe in secular progress as science and technology are improving all the time and

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000
I don't think there's much chance you will go backwards on those even if there's a large scale

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000
or so

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000
on you may go into a period after that sort of major irrationality and

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
that could make some deficits here.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000
I'm about to have to violate the idea that all these new things coming up really allow

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
for a new kind of man a new kind of human being you know the person the

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000
actual man may

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000
be not only different but in ways which I would approve superior to us he

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000
will certainly be surprise was in his standards or almost

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
certainly Can you sketch those out when you see ways that you would improve.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000
Was apples. It's nice to have a country has no poor

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000
people which is everybody is healthy which everybody is deeply interested

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
in something which they may be able to do. And which you don't

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
have concerns of competitive addition of

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000
the more destructive sort. The problem is that when you have a

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000
world which in a sense has no

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000
structure because you have. So many ways of doing things and because the normal things

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:03.000
impose

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.000
structure like fear of an enemy or fear of starvation or coping with some kind

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000
of environmental issue. Or having traditions all these things

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000
disappear and you know almost every choice you have a kind of

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.000
anarchy. And people need structure and it's possible that structures Why such as your structure

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000
when I've my structure. So if you have any by the place choosing the structures.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
You'll get a kind of a cultural anarchy.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000
On the other side of the house. You may simply succeed and weaken the all

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.000
structures to the point where they really don't function that will replace them a new structure.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Well this is that you Asia where some flaws of history would argue is ripe for a new religious to

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000
be funny new religion comes

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000
along and really sweeps everything in front of it and creates this new structures in the

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000
new ideas of meaning and purpose that the

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000
else such processes occur are almost certain to be very bloody and

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
very uncomfortable. The main thing that with it tends to worry me about is whether the future is what we call

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
the fasting issue. You're a member of the or too fast this is one made a

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
pact with the devil the model files that were collected. The second files are

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
getting files made a pact of the devil but that will collect he went to heaven.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:22.000
And there's some sense. Many of the issues that came up are exactly the issues that come up with as well as to place.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000
You know and I think you get this kind of poetic insight which is not maybe in some ways

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000
more perceptive than anything we do here has it and I

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000
think that's an issue we have made a pact not with the devil

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
but with ourselves.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Now what I mean by the pact Well we can choose the sex or children we may be able to choose as there

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.000
are I.Q. We may be able to do but the fact is very likely that if I want to duplicate

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000
myself analyze commissar I can do this by implanting my chromosomes and an egg growing up

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000
and going to some

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
woman. We can change the environment we can.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000
Create enormous kinds of. The pollution if we

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000
want and if you look at these series of possibilities the choices that we

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000
have. Let me pass a list about a hundred separate ways to

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:16.000
go wrong. This is a probably won't take some of these ways.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Some of these mistakes may be really disastrous.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
Certainly qualify don't give

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000
a qualified optimism. You do have a first time in

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000
humanity an incredibly large range of choices about how and why and

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
where to live what meaning what purpose and so

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000
on and then kind of been created before

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.000
we created again you know it would be shocking if you did make a society which was just

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000
extraordinary better than ours in ways which we would approve

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000
of as a factor as better than ours and different in ways we didn't approve what was

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
our problem was we were just propping up that we have a right to force our violent twenty first century.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000
But I really I

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
just

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:07.000
love after all this again thank you so much for this interview.
