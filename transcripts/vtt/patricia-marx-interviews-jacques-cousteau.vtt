00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I am honored to have as my guest today a pioneer in a world never before

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
inhabited by men. Used a renowned scientist Explorer and Academy Award

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
winning film maker Captain Jackie

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Cousteau last year you know his fellow ocean knots. There's a station

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
underwater where several of them live for a month without ever coming to the surface.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Captain Cousteau has shared with us this historic underwater adventure in his second

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
film world without

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
sun getting through so as exploring the sea always been a passion with

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
you where did yes. I am convinced

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
that anybody is knowledge conducted by. Things to

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
happen. For example.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
He was always interested by the sea when I was young.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And it is only circumstances that switched and I never call you to.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The and the thought of the self is. What no up out of the self

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
is what with these circumstances

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
the circumstances. There were two of them when I remember when I was

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
a mature man and Indo-China closing on the world

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
understand

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
that in the Bay of

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Cameron one of the natives

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
that carried us you know rowboat to

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
shore and one day at

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
noon stopped a whole wing went by seeing it

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.000
of a

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
show and then very gently slipped into

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
the water and came back with a fish and his hand and.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
He explained to me that he could only do

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
this at noon. Because at that place.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And this species of fish was taking a nap.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
During the day.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
So take me very much and then I forgot about it and then later on

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
when I was twenty six a fine of nine boards one day eighty

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
some smaller dive

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
goggles made of food and grass

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and when I tested them I was a good

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
swimmer but nothing else. When I tested and you have to

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
learn.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
The complete difference between the

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
jungle type set up. Below and

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
the highly

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
serialized affair

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
selfish and convince me to switch on my free

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
time as a naval officer too.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I met the undersea exploration and then I understand I

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
call loose. In the Chinese star and.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And it inspired me that thinks Paul

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Grant's respected were going on and on and on the surface and that it would be

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
worthwhile doing this very seriously take you

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
both neutral meaning.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Can you tell us the significance of the most recent

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
establishment of a station underwater when men did for a month. What is the purpose of this

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000
kind of

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
mission in purpose is to save time

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and increase the possibilities of intervention.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Diving with the helmet always and I

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
quote. With any kind of method. Even in a bear.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
I submit the human body. To a certain number of.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Rules blazing stand up pleasure thank you sort

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
of these gases in the bread into bread carries the sort of gas into most

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
remote issues of the body.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.000
When one goes back to the surface after I put on stage of.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Depp's.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
When has to be very careful about decomposition because if one does not

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
apply the always gas bubbles can form and buying and bodies

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000
are the

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
bands so far good

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Depp's least said decompression time sell most play B.T.S..

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
For example

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
two

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
and half an hour and

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
two hundred feet. Would mean more than an hour of the

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
compression and

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000
decompression steps may be dangerous to do sea state changes.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
You cannot stop hanging from a vessel in a storm.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000
So

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
this decompression time being very high and

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
higher if you stay longer and how you know if you go deeper and it took a while to us

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
that if when did not come back fire very

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.000
long

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000
time it would be able one could be able to avoid entirely.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Decompression time until the end of the experiment and then only

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
and once thought to go slowly to use

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
decompression that on. And that works very

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.000
well

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.000
so do I think it's a complete solution in the economy of diving.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
What are the psychological effects on underwater for a full month with

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000
never coming to the

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
surface. Psychological effects are there I faced

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
some that. It is to detach them.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
There from the world very rapidly.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
So that that's a little too simple to say that in a few words but that's about

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.000
it so in innocence they don't even want to come up to the surface they feel at home in the sea.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
They feel very much at home yes.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Now we are liking ICS variance in this here

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
because you see at the moment. Those people more or

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
less even if they don't look like it if you like they are here or is that the al beginning in you

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
we are and that this maybe encourages them to do it.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
More than they were doing this just to make their

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
living as the ones that would follow would

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
do so that we don't know what lead a fit their attitude is

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
so seen that it looks like this if it

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
was sincere and at least a part of the

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
sincere when when the.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Nomarski news fund that our wives felt cheated I don't know and they don't you know open

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.000
their

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
letters. Maybe not be very sincere when

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
they say or kept and why do we come back here since

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
one mounts maybe we could do another mass that is also not very sincere I

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
think that what is sincere. Is that

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
nobody asked them for example to abandon their detective stories tend to ask for

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
more interesting books.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Nobody asked them to stop listening to radio broadcasts

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
and called a classic

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
music and that's what happened and I think

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
that day I became.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Much more interested in and sinking in

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
discussing quietly about important observations. They are keen

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
to become part of a new world

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
that interest them from morning to

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
evening with living in the sea like this change one's orientation from a

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
very man centered world we live in on the face of the earth

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
to a different feeling towards nature a man's place in nature.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
I think it does and I think he does maybe more than we

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
think. I

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
think

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
the consequences of

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
this new

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and of this

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:58.000
new the consequences are not yet.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Well determined but with supplies yes.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
I think that mankind is going to find many

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.000
very important sources of Finn station in underwater world.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
And even professionals like myself. Now yet

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
unable to measure the amount of inspiration that will

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
be found there.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000
People use you speak of the resources of the sea you know you don't care about that at all when you say inspiration.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
What kind of thing is I talking

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
about

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
where when you speak of the finish

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
and

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
feel to your vision. Well where do you. Where do you see I'm interviewing you.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
I

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
just picture sculptures. But you

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
don't you don't think of them paid of the amount

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
of metal that they were able to forge the tiny.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Measure that one thinks of the alphabet. When thinks of the I said that's of the arts of the god show

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
the lows of the social system and so

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
on so the only value of the politics of civilization

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:13.000
are

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
not. Material output but

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000
the

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
creative of the creative minds.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
So all of these nines whether they

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
are

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
painters artists use an edge is later

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
this. Find only their installation in

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
the observation of nature when the observation of

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000
nature

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
and science and you

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
now was limited to. Our world all by

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
a world and the style world is has far

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
less than the way.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
For example the total number of species followed by world is not one tenth

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
of the total via

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
species in the West well. That's just an example.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
So I think that.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Also the absence of God the teeth

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
body changes so much are parched

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
two fences that pole raising

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
to evolutionary self thinking.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
So as soon as we would be able to introduce.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
People with their brain and with sensitivity and a lot of a long

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
time I am quite sure they are going to produce unexpected

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
thinks. So you really forsee a time when artists and

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
philosophers and and politicians might experience this new world.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Directly interesting and be influenced by it.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
When I hope that in a few

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
centuries maybe. The part of

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
a far life that will be devoted to.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Activities related to end of life will be part of than the thousand far

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
less devoted to other activities.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
So that generally speaking I'm sure that it will be evolution

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.000
of a far poached to life and to the universe.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.000
It's a rather curious concept in a way because it seems that most.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Advances in civilised and technological terrorists now this is of course is

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
NOT use is not the only tunes we can speak in but they have happened on land.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Are you really asking that evolution take a turn again back to the

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
sea. No no no no no no no no I don't think that man is going to do like the properties

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
of the sea then they turn to the sea and forget about life and no that would

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
be dicey and the stuff that but it hard braided into his

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
life more than the

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
yes there has been a divorce between man and the sea in the past.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Already almost or I think there are a few exceptions but I am

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
not sure that that whole

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
civilization.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Have legions of men. Most of them

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
about Janay ting in the sea.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
God series ations well or at the origin near Shark and

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000
they went

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
inland and that is the reason why.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
And now we found ourselves on most flight and. They just

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
thought that we could even. Live underwater.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
While the Play Misty for operations rather naming of it.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
So I think that this it is high time there is a vast

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000
takes and

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
and. I know of a different approach

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
in your film from other films about the sea that I've

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
seen. In for instance for Disney films there's a feeling of

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
the violence and the destruction and the danger. And the sense I got

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
from your film world without sun was one of beauty

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
and almost of affinity man for

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
underwater creature is this a feeling you have when you're under the sea yourself.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
I do have it. But I know the only one. And the reason why I don't know what it is

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000
now has made many films about the sea but. Anyway he does

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
know decease or. Was making films about a

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
subject he didn't know.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
It's the same as if I was making a subject about something I don't know space for example.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
But people would dive with me whatever they are Gene

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Clemmie to find their actual order. Goes

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
for the same impressionist same category of patients now you

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
do so I think it is universe so I think the generalities

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
basically man is very

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
open to reception

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
of of the nine

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
inferences. Are your ocean not as trained and skilled as

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
the astronauts are just sent up into space.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
But not quite you know. Because I

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000
think

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
I think that's a tremendous part of the training of

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
the astronauts is useless that it makes

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
very nice all to go see the

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
magazines and also the agencies that.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And then when I sponsor for this painting do not want to be a poached.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
To mean the king of imagination and I

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000
thought so but I think astronauts in the future would be men

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.000
like anybody and Oceano it's our leading man owes anybody.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
No special training other than to know how to

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000
dive and. Even so to know at least a little

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
how to die but not on the edge.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
In the first experiment in September of sixty two we had two very well trained

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
divers to get excited going to their sleep in the second

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
experimentally why

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000
didn't

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
they scope out the nature of this people by

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
taking anybody almost one of them even was I don't want to say name it was in that sort

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
of legal case he would have been digested by.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
The Navy medical examination for days

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
on did you do this on purpose. Yes I did to or to

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
see what would happen to such a case he felt very well down it was

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
very much improved. So I knew he was suffering from heart

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
and and your god tell us

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000
colleges and

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
and it worked for Condi also no no no no they were

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000
or mentally

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
healthy the deal really that song was made

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
about the second of these experiments was and yes. Have there been more are there going

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
to be not yet but there will be every you know at least one yes and how will they

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:47.000
expand what was done before going wait for going deeper and.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Changing or so the. Tooling instruments methods of

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
diving and not necessarily staying longer. We have

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000
no place else to expand we know that too we. So you know it's to

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
be representative. If people stand two weeks

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
where they were sent to Mars as well.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
What new things do you want to find

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
out about the man. We want to

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000
know to what depths. There is

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
no inference of pressure.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
On have.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Saw this of course we make some experiments on animals

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
first and we do not waste our life stuff up people but.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000
It's just not quite sure even if animal experiments are successful.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000
And even if people think if you're well he's not quite sure

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000
that there will not be so remote after I think so all of

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
the people go down are volunteers that accept this small

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Leask and it's most interesting to follow

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000
them up to now we have been unable to notice any

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
difference in their health.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
More than one year after the experiment.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
So I think it's very encouraging but we must now go to sleep and

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:25.000
to six hundred feet and maybe later much deeper.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
You know about the decision the ocean. Your primary

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000
interest in a new kind of species that you discover where life

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
exists and how did this are there many interests what are the main questions you're asking.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
May satisfy I'm glad to be looking through a keyhole.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
I'm curious but I don't know what I'm going to see for the key

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000
or so anything interests me whether it is Joe logic

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
obeyed Hugo as am. Thought funding you needed also and I know

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000
very little about this

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
matter and I am glad to find

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000
me especially some of the highest I

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
know genius and specialty. I have apotheosis

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000
of university professors as well as Dr Ph

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
D. say

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
and no go east me and interprets what explain

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000
to me a way to where found. So of course we found

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
many new spacious fish

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
of marine life. Dozens of them.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Each expanded. But this is not to you cannot count the interest of

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000
things by the number of species discovered the behavior of these animals is much more

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000
interesting and

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.000
also to find smaller plagues to

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
the bigger little sense of

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000
life. I was used to think thank yous.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000
It's just a spa day

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000
but it's.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000
I think you need also

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
pollen What

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000
does direct experience with this life under the water.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Make you feel about a sense of purpose or order when you say the riddle of life I mean does

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000
it give you answers does

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
it does no no no and so but did more than the

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:37.000
problem and and after all since we.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Since we explore the world with telescopes with.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
So this help salvation of ourselves seen so in

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:48.000
all

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000
these efforts. Means so need to increase the sense

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
of mystery and and just push your dream it's a little

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
fill there but we. Senoritas all the time you know they're

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000
famous for the infinities of subtlety

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
Aldershot that.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
The Infinity and greatness

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.000
and smallness and infinity and complexity. I think

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
the infinity of complex in complexity is the most

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
puzzling and of course one when sees the infinite variety

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.000
and complexity of various forms of life. You see more vividly than anywhere else because.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
Yes. Well at least. Yes I think

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
so I think so. When you take films of underwater life.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000
Is there a great deal of distortion just by lighting by film

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:51.000
process is necessary or is it actually quite accurate.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
I think now with the new policy as with the new

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
lances lighting equipment and materials.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
I think that we poach there. I

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
added to a good idea.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:16.000
There is certainly less than five percent distortion if you wish.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
We are because now is the screen exactly what we have seen.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000
After

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:27.000
all the very sensitive emotions of today.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Of course we don't see as much of the eye

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000
as when. I don't know I left of

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
sense that but nevertheless the

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
conflict Very where the car rendering and.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000
Ourselves when we die that night when we go we're diving source up to one thousand

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000
feet. We need an artificial

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000
lighting to see and dimension.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.000
And I think that provided that we bring salvation to quantity of flight.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000
There's no distortion days ago today

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000
energy and effectiveness has

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000
been increased tremendously doing the best ten years their technique

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000
of stuffy has been such

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
progress and he's still making progress I think when I make

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000
myself you know and I would probably have enhanced new tools and new

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000
materials to get even better.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.000
I know when physics is the problem is a lot of influence even the minute they

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.000
start testing electrons and others they change their course is this somewhat true

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000
in undersea life the minute you photograph a bright light during the night that you're

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
changing the life patterns of these

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Absolutely. Yes. That is tall and at night

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000
when

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
we dive in shallow water. A for example. With

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000
now being self right. And we find.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
We discover that animals are sleeping sleeping as we

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000
do. And when we put a beam

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:15.000
on

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000
their eyes they are absolutely

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000
hypnotized and they don't move they

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000
stay where they are like air rabbits and I rode in front of a

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000
car. And.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
Diving So saw for example

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000
meets Lorien animals that never saw any light in their life.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Because they only see a luminescence Ballymun essence but no light from the center.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:53.000
So when they see by itself like you I mean to them I'm sure today and they are completely.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000
Altering their behavior. So we

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000
have a very very mean.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000
When we do not take front of us so we never asked to

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000
surprise nature. Where ideas.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000
What would you say is the greatest satisfaction you get from this kind of

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:19.000
work and the greatest satisfaction.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000
You know to think fast.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
Each time I have a meal with my team.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
I feel glad to fight because I see that they always ask

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000
me you know I am their leader but they do not behave with me

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000
as employees.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.000
And they do not do that to criticize a thing so I like that

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000
very much and we have a.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
Pleasure in feigning else else a

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000
meal. The second greatest thing you know we should I

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.000
speak up to

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000
this people and. We know it we are members of

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000
the club and they know it. The

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000
second satisfaction of datasets action from me has been

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000
a series of deep dives in the diving saucer where they were I don't think is going to

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000
fly for nobody had ever.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:26.000
We've ended it. Thanks to your film. Thank you very much for this interview. Captain Jack.
